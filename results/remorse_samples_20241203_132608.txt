Text: only the elites can look at the current state of affairs and say that the economy is doing well then again why would anyone expect them to talk to more importantly to listen to the average worker some of them do and they understand but these people in the main stream media who are primarily sponsored by those entities like pfizer wouldn't be caught talking to regular people so they don't understand nor do they want to it's beneath them to mingle with the plebs that are the middle or lower class unless these people say or do things that reinforces or gives credence to their worldview

Text: my youngest son died from mexican fentanyl and was 'resuscitated' by defibrillation and narcan my thoughts on understanding the fentanyl epidemic kw moegling in the name of secular morality biden's failure to stop the influx of 'fentanyl' can be significantly reduced by reestablishing trump's border enactments that joe obstinately disannulled on the day of his presidency with the stroke of a pen 'quid pro quo joe' could stop the flow of fentanyl and the subsequent deaths of our most precious possessions our children children that would be saved in a 'new york minute' by a trump vote or by writing him in in states where he's been taken off the ballet the staggering statistics laid bare by the cdc are more than just numbers they are a harrowing testament to the devastating impact of the fentanyl epidemic on our society the drastic increase in drug overdose deaths particularly those involving fentanyl paints a grim picture of a crisis that continues to escalate as i delve into the numbers drawing a comparison to the average yearly american military deaths during world war ii the gravity of the situation becomes even more apparent the toll of opioid related deaths in 2020 2021 107 000 surpasses the average annual military personnel deaths during a six year long world war 66 667 keep in mind that this is a rough average and the actual numbers varied from year to year it's an unsettling revelation that compels me to view the opioid epidemic as nothing short of a war on our own soil as 40 333 more americans died in 2021 than the rough annual average during the second world war in my contemplation i can't help but connect the dots to the origins of this crisis the involvement of the chinese communist party and mexican cartels in the production and distribution of fentanyl reflects a ruthless disregard for human life it's a war perpetrated by entities that seem indifferent to the suffering caused by the flood of lethal chemicals coming from china to the mexican cartel by design they are crushing timeless enduring moral values the open border policy in this context is not just a matter of national security but violates every functional moral imperative it s a challenge to the very moral foundations of american democracy the chinese proverb about a sparrow not understanding the ambition of a dragon takes on a bitter resonance karma affords them a perfect opportunity to get even since the west once flooded china with opium china is returning the favor especially when billions of dollars are to be made both china and mexico owe a great debt of gratitude for this administration s open border policy the cycle of revenge embodied in the reciprocal exchange of opium for fentanyl paints a grim picture of morality eroded by profit motives grief is a love word and i grieve for those departed souls who ve died long before their time departed souls who i m sure curse both open borders and the drugs that snuffed their candle out way too soon because of fentanyl which becomes a poignant reminder of the human cost of geopolitical games and criminal enterprises my connection to this crisis deepens as i recount the near loss of my youngest son to a fentanyl overdose his encounter with the drug and the subsequent intervention of a christian african american stranger was lifesaving last year my youngest son traded 5 cigarettes for fentanyl in tacoma washington before long he started to lose consciousness gangs were waiting like hyenas focusing on vulnerable prey to steal his wallet and toyota prius that s when this kind brother stepped in and secured the keys as well as my son s wallet before the gangs could strip the wallet and steal the prius like the good samaritan in luke he then drove my son to the hospital in tacoma and remained there with him my son was given narcan in each nostril when that didn t work they administered defibrillation witnesses heard the doctor s reply it looks like we ve done all we can do when at that moment my son s blue eyes opened may that christian brother be blessed who intervened this underscores the urgent need for change the emotional attachment to songs like the pusher reflects a societal awareness of the heartlessness of those who profit from the suffering of others now i have some skin in the race against our porous and open border policies that are killing americans and almost stole my son from the land of the living who knows how many more will become victims of the sinaloa cartel through 2023 and continue through 2024 as i reflect on george washington's prayer for the nation i can't help but wish for a reality where justice mercy and love prevail over the darkness of the fentanyl epidemic the prayer serves as a timeless plea for a nation guided by principles that transcend greed and political agendas the mexican cartel consumed with greed and lust long ago had forgotten how to love their neighbor their judgment both now and in the hereafter awaits them in closing i sign off as a perpetual student now at the age of 80 with a renewed commitment to understanding and addressing the fentanyl epidemic that has touched my life my son justin s and countless others oh how i wish that george washington s prayer below would have been answered in this generation respectfully karl william moegling circular to the states sunday june 08 1783 mount vernon i now make it my earnest prayer that god would have the united states in his holy protection that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another for their fellow citizens of the united states at large and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field and finally that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the devine author of our blessed religion and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation amen george washington

Text: anyone who calls themselves the god yeah you should listen to that person as for the constitution again the democrats have taken what trump said out of context just like the bloodbath bleach and dictator comments the democrats don t tell you the whole truth what trump said about the constitution was that he felt that interpretation of the words in constitution that allows fraudulent elections should be removed he said our great founders did not want and would not condone false and fraudulent elections imo well anyone and everyone can agree that is a true statement the question is the interpretation of what was a false and fraudulent election not that the statement about the founders is false or that trump wanted to suspend the entire constitution of course trump would believe the election was stolen from him when the polls closed in over seven states he had a substantial lead and then when the mail in ballots were counted over the next couple of days he lost in every state we all need to just stick with the facts not the hype also seek to understand the context trump says crazy stuff like if i had a women s basketball team we would never lose a single game people go no way but his point was that he would have a team of transgender men competing against women after you understand what he is saying it does make sense so seek to understand actions speak louder than words events that really happen like vaccine mandates massive immigration high inflation wars hatred and division unbelievable deficits and debt those are real the hype is just that hype

second world war in my contemplation i can't help but connect the dots to the origins of this crisis the involvement of the chinese communist party and mexican cartels in the production and distribution of fentanyl reflects a ruthless disregard for human life it's a war perpetrated by entities that seem indifferent to the suffering caused by the flood of lethal chemicals coming from china to the mexican cartel by design they are crushing timeless enduring moral values the open border policy in this context is not just a matter of national security but violates every functional moral imperative it s a challenge to the very moral foundations of american democracy the chinese proverb about a sparrow not understanding the ambition of a dragon takes on a bitter resonance karma affords them a perfect opportunity to get even since the west once flooded china with opium china is returning the favor especially when billions of dollars are to be made both china and mexico owe a great debt of gratitude for this administration s open border policy the cycle of revenge embodied in the reciprocal exchange of opium for fentanyl paints a grim picture of morality eroded by profit motives grief is a love word and i grieve for those departed souls who ve died long before their time departed souls who i m sure curse both open borders and the drugs that snuffed their candle out way too soon because of fentanyl which becomes a poignant reminder of the human cost of geopolitical games and criminal enterprises my connection to this crisis deepens as i recount the near loss of my youngest son to a fentanyl overdose his encounter with the drug and the subsequent intervention of a christian african american stranger was lifesaving last year my youngest son traded 5 cigarettes for fentanyl in tacoma washington before long he started to lose consciousness gangs were waiting like hyenas focusing on vulnerable prey to steal his wallet and toyota prius that s when this kind brother stepped in and secured the keys as well as my son s wallet before the gangs could strip the wallet and steal the prius like the good samaritan in luke he then drove my son to the hospital in tacoma and remained there with him my son was given narcan in each nostril when that didn t work they administered defibrillation witnesses heard the doctor s reply it looks like we ve done all we can do when at that moment my son s blue eyes opened may that christian brother be blessed who intervened this underscores the urgent need for change the emotional attachment to songs like the pusher reflects a societal awareness of the heartlessness of those who profit from the suffering of others now i have some skin in the race against our porous and open border policies that are killing americans and almost stole my son from the land of the living who knows how many more will become victims of the sinaloa cartel through 2023 and continue through 2024 as i reflect on george washington's prayer for the nation i can't help but wish for a reality where justice mercy and love prevail over the darkness of the fentanyl epidemic the prayer serves as a timeless plea for a nation guided by principles that transcend greed and political agendas the mexican cartel consumed with greed and lust long ago had forgotten how to love their neighbor their judgment both now and in the hereafter awaits them in closing i sign off as a perpetual student now at the age of 80 with a renewed commitment to understanding and addressing the fentanyl epidemic that has touched my life my son justin s and countless others oh how i wish that george washington s prayer below would have been answered in this generation respectfully karl william moegling circular to the states sunday june 08 1783 mount vernon i now make it my earnest prayer that god would have the united states in his holy protection that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another for their fellow citizens of the united states at large and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field and finally that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the devine author of our blessed religion and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation amen george washington

earnest prayer that god would have the united states in his holy protection that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another for their fellow citizens of the united states at large and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field and finally that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the

Text: stunning is the argument being made by trump absolute legal immunization to the law is exactly what he is asserting in the argument being made by him his lawyers also they are arguing that impeachment is the vehicle for holding a potus accountable never mind the fact that his lawyers argued the exact opposite fact while he was being impeached twice that criminal justice system is the place where he should be held accountable if you support trump i don't but i am no democrat either then simply consider this if trump wins this that means biden could legally have killed without zero consequences that is how crazy this is no matter how many times alina habba goes on tv and blames everyone else and states the law is on their side not it isn't even my children understand this is a no brainer so why why then is trump making this argument i can only conclude he is desperate to avoid consequence its the only explanation an objective rational person can make at this juncture

Text: i hate how every election they try to make it look like the president is shaping world events trump didn't raise the economy he inherited a rising economy despite obamas liberal policies after the 2008 crash he didn't intimidate world leaders he got along with putin who took advantage of it and talked to kim jung un which resulted in nothing within four years of his presidency we had a pandemic and a regression not a boost in the economy the instability that resulted is the reason for all the wars biden inherited a declining economy that just dished out a bunch of stimuluses to make trump look good and a war in ukraine that had been brewing for years don't get me wrong biden is ineffective but y'all blaming him for things that are out of anyone's hands meanwhile praising trump for doing nothing trump is effective at getting votes pardoning key people in communities stimulus packages and social media but no one can tell you what helpful policy he actually passed i said this to someone when i was younger and they started talking about a coal factory that employees people near his job but the president dosen't increase the jobs in your state the most he probably can do is lessen regulations which could help or hurt just depends from my understanding these are the types of policies trump passed which if you ask me him being a businessman and lessen regulations throughout industries was to his benefit and the benefit of rich corporations not everyday americans so his version of make america great again is give the rich more capital and wiggle room to allocate their funds and supplement the declining american population with a high skilled declining european one while stopping immigration from south america but use nafta to import non taxed manufactured goods and products from the region it's an idea but it won't work long term for such a powerful country it's a shame it only knows how to build and maintain wealth by taking advantage of less powerful people

Text: my youngest son died from fentanyl and was 'resuscitated' by defibrillation and narcan my thoughts on understanding the fentanyl epidemic kw moegling in the name of secular morality biden's failure to stop the influx of 'fentanyl' can be significantly reduced by reestablishing trump's border enactments that joe obstinately disannulled on the day of his presidency with the stroke of a pen 'quid pro quo joe' could stop the flow of fentanyl and the subsequent deaths of our most precious possessions our children children that would be saved in a 'new york minute' by a trump vote or by writing him in in states where he's been taken off the ballet the staggering statistics laid bare by the cdc are more than just numbers they are a harrowing testament to the devastating impact of the fentanyl epidemic on our society the drastic increase in drug overdose deaths particularly those involving fentanyl paints a grim picture of a crisis that continues to escalate as i delve into the numbers drawing a comparison to the average yearly american military deaths during world war ii the gravity of the situation becomes even more apparent the toll of opioid related deaths in 2020 2021 107 000 surpasses the average annual military personnel deaths during a six year long world war 66 667 keep in mind that this is a rough average and the actual numbers varied from year to year it's an unsettling revelation that compels me to view the opioid epidemic as nothing short of a war on our own soil as 40 333 more americans died in 2021 than the rough annual average during the second world war in my contemplation i can't help but connect the dots to the origins of this crisis the involvement of the chinese communist party and mexican cartels in the production and distribution of fentanyl reflects a ruthless disregard for human life it's a war perpetrated by entities that seem indifferent to the suffering caused by the flood of lethal chemicals coming from china to the mexican cartel by design they are crushing timeless enduring moral values the open border policy in this context is not just a matter of national security but violates every functional moral imperative it s a challenge to the very moral foundations of american democracy the chinese proverb about a sparrow not understanding the ambition of a dragon takes on a bitter resonance karma affords them a perfect opportunity to get even since the west once flooded china with opium china is returning the favor especially when billions of dollars are to be made both china and mexico owe a great debt of gratitude for this administration s open border policy the cycle of revenge embodied in the reciprocal exchange of opium for fentanyl paints a grim picture of morality eroded by profit motives grief is a love word and i grieve for those departed souls who ve died long before their time departed souls who i m sure curse both open borders and the drugs that snuffed their candle out way too soon because of fentanyl which becomes a poignant reminder of the human cost of geopolitical games and criminal enterprises my connection to this crisis deepens as i recount the near loss of my youngest son to a fentanyl overdose his encounter with the drug and the subsequent intervention of a christian african american stranger was lifesaving last year my youngest son traded 5 cigarettes for fentanyl in tacoma washington before long he started to lose consciousness gangs were waiting like hyenas focusing on vulnerable prey to steal his wallet and toyota prius that s when this kind brother stepped in and secured the keys as well as my son s wallet before the gangs could strip the wallet and steal the prius like the good samaritan in luke he then drove my son to the hospital in tacoma and remained there with him my son was given narcan in each nostril when that didn t work they administered defibrillation witnesses heard the doctor s reply it looks like we ve done all we can do when at that

connection to this crisis deepens as i recount the near loss of my youngest son to a fentanyl overdose his encounter with the drug and the subsequent intervention of a christian african american stranger was lifesaving last year my youngest son traded 5 cigarettes for fentanyl in tacoma washington before long he started to lose consciousness gangs were waiting like hyenas focusing on vulnerable prey to steal his wallet and toyota prius that s when this kind brother stepped in and secured the keys as well as my son s wallet before the gangs could strip the wallet and steal the prius like the good samaritan in luke he then drove my son to the hospital in tacoma and remained there with him my son was given narcan in each nostril when that didn t work they administered defibrillation witnesses heard the doctor s reply it looks like we ve done all we can do when at that moment my son s blue eyes opened may that christian brother be blessed who intervened this underscores the urgent need for change the emotional attachment to songs like the pusher reflects a societal awareness of the heartlessness of those who profit from the suffering of others now i have some skin in the race against our porous and open border policies that are killing americans and almost stole my son from the land of the living who knows how many more will become victims of the sinaloa cartel through 2023 and continue through 2024 as i reflect on george washington's prayer for the nation i can't help but wish for a reality where justice mercy and love prevail over the darkness of the fentanyl epidemic the prayer serves as a timeless plea for a nation guided by principles that transcend greed and political agendas the mexican cartel consumed with greed and lust long

understanding and addressing the fentanyl epidemic that has touched my life my son justin s and countless others oh how i wish that george washington s prayer below would have been answered in this generation respectfully karl william moegling circular to the states sunday june 08 1783 mount vernon i now make it my earnest prayer that god would have the united states in his holy protection that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another for their fellow citizens of the united states at large and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field and finally that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that charity humility and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the devine author of our blessed religion and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation amen george washington

Text: my youngest son died from fentanyl and was 'resuscitated' my thoughts on understanding the fentanyl epidemic kw moegling the staggering statistics laid bare by the cdc are more than just numbers they are a harrowing testament to the devastating impact of the fentanyl epidemic on our society the drastic increase in drug overdose deaths particularly those involving fentanyl paints a grim picture of a crisis that continues to escalate as i delve into the numbers drawing a comparison to the average yearly american military deaths during world war ii the gravity of the situation becomes even more apparent the toll of opioid related deaths in 2020 2021 107 000 surpasses the average annual military personnel deaths during a six year long world war 66 667 keep in mind that this is a rough average and the actual numbers varied from year to year it's an unsettling revelation that compels me to view the opioid epidemic as nothing short of a war on our own soil as 40 333 more americans died in 2021 than the rough annual average during the second world war in my contemplation i can't help but connect the dots to the origins of this crisis the involvement of the chinese communist party and mexican cartels in the production and distribution of fentanyl reflects a ruthless disregard for human life it's a war perpetrated by entities that seem indifferent to the suffering caused by the flood of lethal chemicals coming from china to the mexican cartel by design they are crushing timeless enduring moral values the open border policy in this context is not just a matter of national security but violates every functional moral imperative it s a challenge to the very moral foundations of american democracy the chinese proverb about a sparrow not understanding the ambition of a dragon takes on a bitter resonance karma affords them a perfect opportunity to get even since the west once flooded china with opium china is returning the favor especially when billions of dollars are to be made both china and mexico owe a great debt of gratitude for this administration s open border policy the cycle of revenge embodied in the reciprocal exchange of opium
