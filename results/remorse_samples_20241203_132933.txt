Text: he no longer has control over them either he may think he does but he lost that a couple of years ago when he tried to say that he made the vaccination and got booed so badly that there was literal fright on his face for a brief second because he realized the monster was not under his control anymore he may be able to guide parts of it but i think it's less than he thinks it is

Text: it made sense to close schools initially when we 1 didn t understand how to treat the infected 2 vaccines were unavailable 3 treatments for chronic infections was not available and 4 hospitals beds were scarce today it is not anywhere close to justifying the extreme measures taken early on the socioeconomicly vulnerable bore the brunt of the consequences of prolonged lockdowns and school closures as far as preventing child deaths from cv19 it s easy to tilt at windmills thinking we could have saved those who died maybe maybe not i think there was an appropriate time to close schools a time for flexible reopens that time has passed the world is different today than it was in 2020 21 and even from 2022 we have the ability to live with cv19 now with very low risk

Sample #3
Text: well i agree with your perspective that we shouldn t go around discounting the deaths of any children at the same time you better be very careful about one in 1 million children die from vaccinations it s very rare but we made the calculation that it is more important to vaccinate even though there is that risk one presumes that there are researchers doing their very best to find ways to prevent those very rare deaths but when a parent says that they don t want to vaccinate their child because they re afraid that their child will be one of those one in 1 million people give them a hard time they say we have to fall the science they say that we have to weigh the risk versus the greater good and so perhaps they are only 150 children who die every year from getting vaccinated that s a very small number two but i could use your same logic what s the right number how many kids are ok to die the truth of the matter is life is a risk we get in our car and we drive and we risk getting into an accident we walk on the street and we risk getting bit by a spider or falling in a hole we step in the shower we risk slipping and falling and hitting our head every day every action we take is risk the entire thing that we as people and society do is try to calculate what risk is acceptable in order to live life after all we could all lock ourselves in our homes never shower take medication s all the time to prevent every single bacteria from getting near us and perhaps put on a vr headset and interact with the world in that way and who knows maybe someday that will be the way human beings will live but i think that today we ve decided that human beings need to at least from time to time interact with each other they need to go outside in the sun as i have lived through this covid situation just like everyone else i keep coming back to the question what is acceptable risk and the answer keeps being the risk that you were willing to accept for yourself or the people who you are responsible for now i will wear a mask when i feel it s necessary i ve been vaccinated i ve done the things that i feel makes sense for me and my perspective on those risks what i don t think that we ve come to grips with as a democratic society as a pluralistic liberal society is where the line is between your assessment of risk for you and your family and mine i think it s a fair question to ask i think it s fair for parents all over the world to be able to ask the question how do i keep myself in my family safe while still living life and providing both for myself and my family and for all the different dimensions of life that are necessary in order to be healthy it s not just about disease it s about every other thing that makes life worth living i m not suggesting that the extreme anti vax folks who refuse to acknowledge any facts are right but i think we do our society a disservice by automatically discounting their concerns it is fair to ask if a vaccine is safe it is fair to ask whether staying home from school or going to school is the better choice and i don t think it s cut and dry enough in fact i don t think we re going to know the answer to all this until a decade or two from now we re going to look back and we re going to know one way or the other what the right choice was one thing i ve come to understand about leader ship which is something that we did not have in 2020 is that there s always an unknown as a leader you have to take all the information that you have and make the best possible choice you can with that information invariably you ll be a little bit right and a little bit wrong leadership means taking that risk of being a little bit wrong and taking your lumps for those things that you did that didn t work but i think as a society we ve become a little bit waffly we no longer trust our leaders and there s a good reason why but that is a vicious loop as we trust our leaders les they re gonna make worst decisions and it s gonna keep going down we need to find a way to properly evaluate who we can actually trust to be in a position to make decisions on our behalf we are not there right now

Text: shocking that mehdi hasan would post such a biased video without understanding the cost benefit analysis in fact while children may have died during the pandemic the percentages were quite small and were heavily related to comorbidities and within minority populations yes closing schools prior to the availability of vaccines when we knew very little made sense but after that it did not also mandating vaccination in schools when so many children were residing with unvaccinated relatives made no sense the mental health crisis among children was already problematic prior to the pandemic and the quarantine surely exacerbated the situation far more than the risk of children dying from covid as a special educator i have observed first hand the damage that has been done in nyc clearly mehdi's ability to analyze the scientific research is far inferior to his ability to garner an audiences attention i would not have expected such an uninformed argument from him

Sample #14
Text: the night a subtly eerie incident befell night mare a lago actualized slightly extended it was a lovely starlit night beyond the artificially lightened land when a blood curdling scream brutally shattered the quiet it came from the humbly luxurious abode of the ex president trump continued to screech although he now was fully awake thrashing heavily about in his sweat soaked bed desperately trying to get free of the wet clinging sheets never had he had a dream like this it was pure horror he heaved for air and started sobbing and howling pitifully the nightmare had been so terribly vivid and it felt so real still so terribly unfamiliarly real in his dream he had woken up turned on the tv as usual and there was nothing there about him not even fox news talked about him not even cnn there was not a word and not a picture of him anywhere on social media nor in any newspaper no mention of him anywhere on the radio next thing he knew he was holding a news conference but something was dreadfully wrong the tv cameras were not rolling the journalists were not taking notes nor raising their arms to ask questions frantic with a crumbling sensation he regaled them with the most magnificent lie he could think of only to be met with turning backs and graveyard silence it was as if all hot air leaked out of him he felt like he was imploding in the dream he woke up again and realized he no longer was the president and an odd mix of despair and relief filled him then he remembered that he was the successful famous and popular owner of truth social and a gleeful yelp escaped him as he grabbed his phone to revel in all the massive praise and glory of his very own tremendously glamorous person the pages were never ending side up and side down they were all a complete blank all of a sudden he found himself standing in the middle of 5th avenue there were people everywhere people smiling and talking buying ice cream and popcorn from street vendors hoisting laughing children onto their shoulders as if awaiting some kind of celebration no one ever looked his way the dismay he felt was suffocating petrifying he felt as though he was losing all sense of himself the voices of the multitude surrounding him faded until there was an absolute silence suddenly a sound like a shot rang out and he recoiled in fear looking at his hands expecting them to be blackened by sooty powder in his inner ear he heard screams in his inner eye he saw fingers pointing at him and big hands coming for him strong firm big hands that didn't bother with protecting his head as they rammed him into a waiting car realizing he had uttered a pitiful squeal and instinctively thrown up his arms he quickly tried to compose his face in regal haughty folds as he stared wildly out at the crowd accomplishing nothing but a stiff crusty grimace but the people around him took no notice they didn't seem to have heard the terrible sound and continued oblivious of him they were a colorful crowd a joyous crowd a hugely immense crowd a paralyzing desolation invaded him just then sounds began to creep back all around him and he became aware that the masses of people of whom many were now dancing in the streets were cheering and chanting his name but also another word an ugly word a word that had no business being together with his name the desperate righteousness that hearing this word produced in him made even the weak hairs on his scalp stand on end it was chillingly clear to him that this was not his kind of crowd these were not the manipulable people he despised so dearly where were they the people whose stupidity he loved and who in return loved the untruths and derision he so generously bedazzled them with panic set his bowels churning when it struck him that maybe he had been grifting them too greedily leaving them without even the bus fare to come to his defense when he needed to muster them they his adoring troops that there was an absolute absence of red hats amidst the surrounding celebratory crowd kindled within him a dreadful gut throttling sensation of being starved of all nourishment in the window of a storefront he glimpsed images of the crowd and thinking that he would feel better if only he could see his own majestic bulk mirrored back at him he moved towards the store his going syrupy and slow as if his feet generated a viscous swamp around them with every step he had hardly positioned himself before the glass when the mirror effect vanished in its stead he was now looking straight into deep grey fields fields filled with gravestones a tired dirty golden banner was stretched out above them decorated with the sprawling words president trump fixes the covid hoax he could not avoid noting that a great big number of the gravestones were topped with beautiful red hats but his precious letters didn't look quite right to him and upon squinting the letters abruptly shouted out into his face make americans dead before he had time to reflect on this however the gravestone fields took on a shimmering quality as if seen through a film of reluctantly flowing tears despite this a sharply defined white domed building had appeared looming in the background and fronted by a monstrous gallows and noose and even as from a great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting someone to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to sluggishly want to move towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed yes this wee short story may be long for youtube but people are enjoying it and encouraging me to keep on sharing

Text: i for myself never really got my optimism back since the pandemic it is like we got hit with something so extraordinarily awful that i lost trust that we will be able to prevent the next pandemic my pessimism is due to that normalcy is still not back i think biden is doing an amazing job and he is one of the best presidents we have had and seems like he was really what we needed after the pandemic but overall pessimism hits me daily and that's not due to money or economy or anything else maga is like a pandemic as well the one we have no vaccine for and the one that our masks can't protect us against thus intellectually i understand biden's achievements and celebrate them but this gloom that started with the pandemic is still amongst us reminding me at least daily that the world as we know it is no longer there

Text: i never could understand why they were so intent on killing off their own voters nobody credible ever said you were immune to covid if you got vaccinated that is not how it works that is not what a vaccine is there's no cure for viruses that's precisely why vaccines were developed in the first place so your immune system would recognize the virus particles if your body came into contact with them and you became infected and wouldn't overreact the symptoms aren't really from the virus they are from your immune system's reaction to the invading virus particles and with an unknown or novel virus your immune system can overreact and in some cases not stop reacting that's what is called a cytokine storm and that weakens you the intense effect on normal bodily functions you can't put all this on a bumper sticker or a billboard but where is the sense in lying about what vaccines are

Text: i do understand the 16 47 concern of racism but the vaccines went out to everyone young and old and the only deference for first receiving the first vaccines was to be high risk the testing was done on volunteers and they had been studying corona viruses for almost 2 decades attempting to make vaccines for other known corona viruses and not covid 19 since it had not existed until the pandemic so the tailoring of it was not that big of an extreme when they amped up the pace this was of global necessity not just about the u s you re welcome your friendly nurse

Text: the night a subtly eerie incident befell night mare a lago actualized somewhat extended it was a lovely starlit night beyond the artificially lightened land when a blood curdling scream brutally shattered the quiet it came from the humbly luxurious abode of the ex president trump continued to screech although he now was fully awake thrashing heavily about in his sweat soaked bed desperately trying to get free of the wet clinging sheets never had he had a dream like this it was pure horror he heaved for air and started sobbing and howling pitifully the nightmare had been so terribly vivid and it felt so real still so terribly unfamiliarly real in his dream he had woken up turned on the tv as usual and there was nothing there about him not even fox news talked about him not even cnn there was not a word and not a picture of him anywhere on social media nor in any newspaper no mention of him anywhere on the radio next thing he knew he was holding a news conference but something was dreadfully wrong the tv cameras were not rolling the journalists were not taking notes nor raising their arms to ask questions frantic with a crumbling sensation he regaled them with the most magnificent lie he could think of only to be met with turning backs and graveyard silence it was as if all hot air leaked out of him he felt like he was imploding in the dream he woke up again and realized he no longer was the president and an odd mix of despair and relief filled him then he remembered that he was the successful famous and popular owner of truth social and a gleeful yelp escaped him as he grabbed his phone to revel in all the massive praise and glory of his very own tremendously glamorous person the pages were never ending side up and side down they were all a complete blank all of a sudden he found himself standing in the middle of 5th avenue there were people everywhere people smiling and talking buying ice cream and popcorn from street vendors hoisting laughing children onto their shoulders as if awaiting some kind of celebration no one ever looked his way the dismay he felt was suffocating petrifying he felt as though he was losing all sense of himself the voices of the multitude surrounding him faded until there was an absolute silence suddenly a sound like a shot rang out and he recoiled in fear looking at his hands expecting them to be blackened by sooty powder in his inner ear he heard screams in his inner eye he saw fingers pointing at him and big hands coming for him strong firm big hands that didn't bother with protecting his head as they rammed him into a waiting squad car realizing he had uttered a pitiful squeal and instinctively thrown up his arms he quickly tried to compose his face in regal haughty folds as he stared wildly out at the crowd accomplishing nothing but a stiff crusty grimace but the people around him took no notice they did not seem to have heard the terrible sound and continued oblivious of him they were a colorful crowd a joyous crowd a hugely immense crowd a paralyzing desolation invaded him just then sounds began to creep back all around him and he became aware that the masses of people of whom many were now dancing in the streets were cheering and chanting his name but also another word an ugly word a word that had no business being together with his name the desperate righteousness that hearing this word produced in him made even the weak hairs on his scalp stand on end it was chillingly clear to him that this was not his kind of crowd these were not the manipulable people he despised so dearly where were they the people whose stupidity he loved and who in return loved the untruths and derision he so generously bedazzled them with panic set his bowels churning when it struck him that maybe he had been grifting them too greedily leaving them without even the bus fare to come to his defense when he needed to muster them they his adoring troops that there was an absolute absence of red hats amidst the surrounding celebratory crowd kindled within him a dreadful gut throttling sensation of being starved of all nourishment in the window of a storefront he glimpsed images of the crowd and thinking that he would feel better if only he could see his own majestic bulk mirrored back at him he moved towards the store his going syrupy and slow as if his feet generated a viscous swamp around them with every step he had hardly positioned himself before the glass when the mirror effect vanished in its stead he was now looking straight into deep grey fields fields filled with gravestones a tired dirty golden banner was stretched out above them decorated with the sprawling words president trump fixes the covid hoax he could not avoid noting that a great big number of the gravestones were topped with beautiful red hats but his precious letters didn't look quite right to him and upon squinting the letters abruptly shouted out into his face make americans dead before he had time to reflect on this however the gravestone fields took on a shimmering quality as if seen through a film of reluctantly flowing tears despite this a sharply defined white domed building had appeared looming in the background and fronted by a monstrous gallows and noose and even as from a great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting one certain insipid looking white haired human to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to be sluggishly moving towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed yes this wee short story may be a tad long for youtube but people are enjoying it and encouraging me to continue sharing i was inspired to write the original story one fine halloween back when trump was president recent turn of events compelled me to dust it off make a few changes and adjustments and add some references to a little of what has been happening what has been said and what has been done trump wise after that essentially just actualize it a bit as it were

Text: i've just realized something bone chilling about the grip that putin has over donald trump remember when covid was at its worst before the vaccine had been developed when trump was still president he sidelined a large shipment of ventilators requested by colorado and sent those ventilators to russia instead at the same time trump had defective russian ventilators ones which would occasionally catch fire shipped to america and forced america to pay russia for the defective ventilators guess what putin is likely to push trump into doing if he manages to shoehorn trump back into the white house putin may get trump to strip the us military of all of its best weaponry and send that equipment to russia in order for putin to resupply his cancerously corrupt russian armies with the best military equipment around then putin would probably start a massive military effort to take over country after country in europe while crushing america into the position of a third rate satellite province of russia during the covid crisis trump was willing to let americans in need of working ventilators die in order to fulfill putin's wishes it will be far worse if trump hands over us military equipment to putin if trump gets back into the white house

Text: hey morally bankrupt mika joe you two liars incompetent joe biden s 7 biggest failures and why he should resign and never be re elected to office 1 border crisis biden democrats allowed security at the southern border has been an ongoing disaster though one barely given coverage by the legacy fake news media 2 messy afghanistan withdrawal biden s shambolic withdrawal from afghanistan was certainly one if his lowest points of his fail presidency and one of the lowest points of american foreign policy since the fall of saigon at the end of the vietnam war 3 return to energy dependence the afghanistan mess wasn t the only foreign policy debacle so far under biden russia launched a major invasion of ukraine in the days before the president s state of the union speech unbelievably former secretary of state john kerry biden s climate czar said the situation in ukraine is worrying because russia will be totally distracted from staying on track to fight climate change it s an illustration of just how misguided the biden administration s priorities are in 2018 during donald trump s presidency the united states became a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years technological innovations alongside the president trumps administration policies to open up more opportunities for drilling while eliminating regulations dramatically increased american energy independence and global influence on energy issues plus gas prices were low and stable and inflation was low too 4 authoritarian covid 19 mandates remember when biden said he would shut down the covid 19 virus and not the economy well most americans now believe that covid 19 is here to stay no matter what we do this after biden reached beyond the powers of his office to force americans to get vaccinated and tell states to enforce the most stringent mask mandatesbiden tried to force private employers and other organizations with over 100 or more employees to enforce a vaccine mandate despite saying that he didn t think it was exactly constitutional the supreme court agreed and struck down the executive order in january 5 crime surge under biden democrats american cities have experienced an explosion of violent crime since the summer of 2020 it s a trend that shows no sign of abating in december eve liberal abc news reported that a dozen u s cities had set homicide records in 2021 this trend coincided with and almost certainly was exacerbated by the defund the police movement in fact many democrat run cities made good on this slogan by defunding their police departments and stemming the use of proactive policing no surprise that cities that defunded police agencies often make the list of places with the largest increases in violent crime now some of these city leaders are changing their tune and restoring police funding after much of the damage has been done this hasn t stopped reckless left wing district attorneys such as chesa boudin in san francisco and alvin bragg in new york city from selectively deciding not to prosecute crimes biden mostly has dodged the idea that radical policies embraced by his democratic party are to blame for this issue 6 rising biden democrats skyrocketing us inflation in july biden said inflation would be a temporary problem that his administration had a handle on i want to be clear my administration understands that were we ever to experience unchecked inflation in the long term that would pose a real challenge for our economy biden said while we re confident that isn t what we re seeing today we re going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed what a lie that was now we re well into the new year and if anything inflation is getting worse for most americans inflation has become almost impossible to ignore even leading democrats have acknowledged that inflation is getting out of control in december inflation hit 7 the highest it has been since 1982 but this isn t the same situation as in the 1980s we are on the other side of the wave as the wall street journal has noted in 1982 inflation had fallen from its peak of 14 8 in 1980 the last year of jimmy carter s one term presidency correcting course required tight monetary policies from the federal reserve and a quick but sharp recession to pull the country out of the spiral upon becoming federal reserve chairman in 1979 paul volcker set out to crush inflation with tight monetary policy said greg ip in the wall street journal in combination with credit controls that effort pushed the u s into a brief recession in 1980 then as the fed s benchmark interest rate reached 19 in 1981 a much deeper recession began by the summer of 1982 inflation and interest rates were both falling sharply four decades of generally low single digit inflation would follow today inflation is rising not falling and it s been exacerbated by the policies of the biden administration rather than being lessened as it was in 1981 by the policies of the reagan administration rachel greszler an economics expert at the heritage foundation explains that biden and his legislative allies are making a bad situation worse 7 biden administration war on parents violent crime is spinning out of control but the justice department clearly doesn t see that as the real threat to this country no the real threat is parents who disagree with what s happening in their local schools parents around the country even in far left liberal san francisco have been organizing in response to the misguided and often egregious policies of many k 12 schools from the inclusion of critical race theory and similar racialized ideas in classroom curriculum to over the top covid 19 restrictions that forced students to stay home for over a year or wear masks all day long parents are fed up the result has been old fashioned self government in action however the response from the left has been to call transparency a threat to democracy demonize parents and threaten them with an fbi investigation in october attorney general merrick garland sent out a calling on the fbi to investigate violent threats against school officials and teachers despite a lack of evidence of such threats the biden administration actually moved to treat parents as if they were domestic terrorists it appears that garland s memo was urged on by the national school boards association which represents many local school boards the association also receives a huge amount of money from teachers unions in addition garland s son in law is a co founder of an organization that advocates culturally responsive training and other ideas associated with critical race theory so the attorney general s memo wasn t only an uncalled for threat to parents it also appeared to involve some serious conflicts of interest thank god garland is not on the supreme court pray for our country remember god s in charge and will have final word

Text: as far as covid goes trump's response was by any reasonable measure inadequate and far too late i found a comment online posted by someone comparing the trump response to covid with the obama response to ebola even more dangerous than covid it is worth reposting here for anyone complaining about trump being blamed for the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic i thought i would post a little history lesson for everyone on both sides of the political divide i think it s important that we understand the truth especially come november when it s time to vote forgive the length but hey we all have time on our hands to read correct in december 2013 an 18 month old boy in guinea was bitten by a bat and died a brutal death a day later after that there were five more fatal cases when ebola spread out of the guinea borders into neighboring liberia and sierra leone in july 2014 president obama activated the emergency operations center at the centers for disease control in atlanta the cdc immediately deployed cdc personnel to west africa to coordinate a response that included vector tracing testing education logistics and communication altogether the cdc under president obama trained 24 655 medical workers in west africa educating them on how to prevent and control the disease before a single case left africa or reached the u s working with the u n and the world health organization president obama ordered the re routing of travelers heading to the u s through certain specific airports equipped to handle mass testing back home in america more than 6 500 people were trained through mock outbreaks and practice scenarios that was done before a single case hit america three months after president obama activated this unprecedented response on september 30 2014 we detected our first case in the u s a a man had traveled from west africa to dallas and somehow slipped through the testing protocol he was immediately detected and isolated he died a week later two nurses who tended to him contracted ebola but later recovered all the protocols had worked it was contained the ebola epidemic could have easily become a pandemic but thanks to the actions of our government under president obama it never did those three ebola confirmed cases were the only cases of ebola in the u s a because obama did what needed to be done three months prior to the first case ebola is even more contagious than covid 19 had obama not acted swiftly millions of americans would have died horrible painful deaths like something out of a horror movie if you ve never seen how ebola kills it s horrific it is ironic because since president obama acted decisively we forget about his actions since the disease never reached our shores now the story of covid 19 and trump s response that we know about thus far before anyone even knew about the disease even in china trump disbanded the pandemic response team that obama had put in place he cut funding to the cdc and he cut our contribution to the world health organization who trump fired rear admiral timothy ziemer the person on the national security council in charge of stopping the spread of infectious diseases before they reach our country a position created by the obama administration when the outbreak started in china trump assumed it was china s problem and sent no research supplies or help of any kind we were in a trade war why should he help them in january he received a briefing from our intelligence organizations that the outbreak was much worse than china was admitting and that it would definitely hit our country if something wasn t done to prevent it he ignored the report not trusting our own intelligence when the disease spread to europe the world health organization offered a plethora of tests to the united states trump turned them down saying private companies here would make the tests better if we needed them however he never ordered u s companies to make tests and they had no profit motive to do so on their own according to scientists at yale and several public university medical schools when they asked for permission to start working on our own testing protocol and potential treatments or vaccines they were denied by trump s fda when trump knew about the first case in the united states he did nothing it was just one case and the patient was isolated when doctors and scientists started screaming in the media that this was a mistake trump claimed it was a liberal hoax conjured up to try to make him look bad after impeachment failed the next time trump spoke of covid 19 we had sixty four confirmed cases but trump went before microphones and told the american public that we only had fifteen cases and pretty soon that number will be close to zero all while the disease was spreading he took no action to get more tests what trump did was to stop flights from china from coming here this was too late and accomplished nothing according to scientists and doctors by then the disease was worldwide and was already spreading exponentially in the u s by americans not chinese people as trump would like you to believe as of the moment i am posting this the evening of april 7 2020 we have 368 449 covid 19 confirmed cases and 10 992 covid 19 deaths in the u s a the actual number is undoubtedly more than triple that amount donald trump is not a leader

Text: this is a typical hatchet job from a left leaning media source they won't interview rfk jr on msnbc but instead find some dnc hack who says he interviewed him where is this interview from the mass media's misrepresentation of him i thought that jfk jr had gone over to the dark side but listening to his interviews with joe rogan and others on youtube and elsewhere i've come to understand him as a sincere and deeply spiritual recovering alcoholic addict with over 40 years of sobriety and rigorously honest who is not anti vax but anti possibly flawed vaccines that because of the 1985 act of congress which exempted vaccine makers from liability have never been subjected to the intense rigors of thorough and prolonged evaluation and accountability which other medications are required to undergo and who through his courageous law practice has secured many judgments of millions upon millions of dollars due to damage caused by big pharma's unavoidably unsafe vaccines a man who reflects his father's empathy and humility and deep sense of justice and vision a man who through decades of seeking environmental and medical justice through the courts is uniquely qualified to detoxify and reorganize the captured agencies of the epa now run by big oil and big ag and the fda run by big pharma and the monolithic big food industry among others doesn't the fact that he's seen favorably by republicans independence and democrats tell us that his blatant dismissal of the old hackneyed good guys bad guys political construct rampant in the beltway and which has caused the deepest polarization since the civil war and his refusal to assign or question others' motives but only their policies are part of our path to healing the divide hey with his tortured voice i know he's not easy to listen to but if you listen with your head and your heart and not your spleen you'll find he's his father's son indeed

Text: i watched this interview and read joe hagan's article and my opinion is that rather than rfk being an exhausting conspiracy theorist joe hagan is lazy and what he and msnbc are doing is sloppy thin journalism for example joe's article makes note of three books on rfk jr's shelf which i guess is supposed to tell us about kennedy's character odd because i watched a few interviews with rfk jr and he's got at least 300 books on his shelf joe narrowed in on 1 of them how selective how lazy what a waste of an hour another example in joe's article he claims that rfk jr mis represented covid deaths however joe failed to understand the point of the death comparison which should be against the total morbidity not just deaths attributed to covid if a vaccine is causing injury those deaths will not appear in covid death statistics but rather in statistics that track the cause of death ie myocarditus a reduction in covid deaths over time is an expected result from natural immunity and not defacto sign of a working vaccine another example joe claimed to have listened to a free chapter of rfk jr's book on faucii i'm reading the whole thing and so far any single chapter is more than enough for any reasonable person to want answers about the mismanagement of public health resources but apparently not a journalist for vanity fair last example and maybe i'm nitpicking and i'm a conspiracy theorist but the manchurian candidate line in his article is disrespectful joe scarbourough claimed rfk jr's assertions about vaccines are easily refuted ok do it to his face and defend your thorough examination of where you think he made error otherwise what exactly are you talking about to claim that rfk jr is providing 'too much information' and that the length of time to refute his claims will always outpace 'the truth' is beyond lazy if you understand a subject well enough it's easy to explain and can be done so quickly shame

Text: this is nothing new the rich have always avoided paying taxes through loopholes created by the politicians these ultra rich dirt bags donate large sums of cash to from the richest people to the greediest corporations they all know if they grease the pockets of politicians allow them to use their corporate jets and vacation bungalows in exotic places if they just keep writing them checks to keep the wheels of corruption turning the majority of the tax burden will always fall on the working class and poor the right have been openly defending this corruption with lies and talking points like the rich are the job creators so why wouldn't we reduce their taxes from what used to be 90 down to about 2 if that does anyone remember the very same republican running for president who was caught investing in a company who destroyed aborted fetuses also said corporations are people too my friend this is why we have citizens united a law that allows corporations to donate any amount of money they want to any candidate without having to report it while citizens can not do that not legally or financially now corporate greed is electing politicians instead of the people this is all by design and its only purpose is to further corrupt the entire system of government with greed with unspeakable amounts of cold hard cash it is money that decides elections now and the largest donors not the people what is so sickening is we all know the system is broken unfair corrupt the tax dollars the government steals from working class and poor americans help keep the wheels of corruption turning there was a time when there was no such thing as income tax for the working class the rich were taxed 90 on their insane amount of profit and they still made more money in a fiscal year than the bottom 60 of american working class families did the wage gap is ever growing and the politicians of this country have been comfortably getting away with working directly against the people with the fa ade of representing the people both sides do it but it is only the right who have been turned in to anti american anti government domestic terrorists who are clearly going to support everything the right wing wants to do to put the final nail in the coffin of the working class and poor while trying to dismantle the wheels of justice and any attempt to hold the enemies of this country in the party accountable we have gotten to a place that most people see as extremely difficult to ever come back from if at all this is our new reality where the politicians get away with murder tax evasion money laundering insider trading fake colleges stealing from their own charities grifting their base stealing top secret government documents etc etc etc and the left pretend to represent the people while the likes of corey booker and others deny the citizens the right to purchase cheaper pharmaceuticals on line from other countries in my opinion the left is just the lesser of the two evils but part of the corruption and evil none the less the reason republicans saw fit to destroy our democracy is because they know it is just an illusion to begin with every election votes are thrown away or not counted due to insane laws passed by both parties where the poorest americans are more or less taxed to vote we need to see some id sir to make sure you are an american even though you are 80 years old served our country in the form of military duty and paid your taxes every year like a good boy or girl even though we know you are an american because the fewer votes we count the less of a chance the people will actually decide this election when a pandemic hits we will play good cop bad cop and pretend that giving back to the tax payers aka the working class and poor in the form of stimulus money and free vaccines is going to destroy the economy and we can even blame those vaccines and tiny stimulus checks for the economy even though it is actually lack of money coming in due to the rich not paying their fair share and a massive spending problem and other issues like the government saying they can not account for trillions of dollars that went to black book budgets and scams and secret programs that actually pays billions to our enemies across the globe the complete corruption process is over every aspect of our democracy is corrupted and broken and fixed and a scam designed to keep the working class compliant hopeless afraid desperate and in a constant state of fear and loathing they will distract us with stupid things like gender issues and who can use what bathroom and who can and can not get married and how many wars will america create or fight or how many false flag operations can we use to terrify people i personally believe this experiment of democracy is already over it is a failure not because the ideas were off but because of corrupt people corrupting every aspect of government and with every case of corruption the following coverup makes things more confusing and more hopeless for everyone it got to the point of the american people not knowing if the government bombed its own country to create a false sense of chaos to distract from some more corruption or not if that doesn't say it all i don't know what would but until we all get on the same page and demand justice demand change and demand the politicians the supreme court justices and the justice system and every other government agency stop the insanity we are just going to get more of the same old tired insanity only the effect on the working class and poor will increase dramatically going forward i know mot people already understand everything i have said but it is what to do to fix it that no one can agree on if we have to depend on the people in office who broke it to begin with to fix it we are all screwed

Text: here is real news on biden not fake nbc msnbc propaganda incompetent joe biden s 7 biggest failures and why he should resign and never be re elected to office facts below confirm why 1 border crisis biden democrats allowed security at the southern border has been an ongoing disaster though one barely given coverage by the legacy fake news media 2 messy afghanistan withdrawal biden s shambolic withdrawal from afghanistan was certainly one if his lowest points of his fail presidency and one of the lowest points of american foreign policy since the fall of saigon at the end of the vietnam war 3 return to energy dependence the afghanistan mess wasn t the only foreign policy debacle so far under biden russia launched a major invasion of ukraine in the days before the president s state of the union speech unbelievably former secretary of state john kerry biden s climate czar said the situation in ukraine is worrying because russia will be totally distracted from staying on track to fight climate change it s an illustration of just how misguided the biden administration s priorities are in 2018 during donald trump s presidency the united states became a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years technological innovations alongside the president trumps administration policies to open up more opportunities for drilling while eliminating regulations dramatically increased american energy independence and global influence on energy issues plus gas prices were low and stable and inflation was low too 4 authoritarian covid 19 mandates remember when biden said he would shut down the covid 19 virus and not the economy well most americans now believe that covid 19 is here to stay no matter what we do this after biden reached beyond the powers of his office to force americans to get vaccinated and tell states to enforce the most stringent mask mandatesbiden tried to force private employers and other organizations with over 100 or more employees to enforce a vaccine mandate despite saying that he didn t think it was exactly constitutional the supreme court agreed and struck down the executive order in january 5 crime surge under biden democrats american cities have experienced an explosion of violent crime since the summer of 2020 it s a trend that shows no sign of abating in december eve liberal abc news reported that a dozen u s cities had set homicide records in 2021 this trend coincided with and almost certainly was exacerbated by the defund the police movement in fact many democrat run cities made good on this slogan by defunding their police departments and stemming the use of proactive policing no surprise that cities that defunded police agencies often make the list of places with the largest increases in violent crime now some of these city leaders are changing their tune and restoring police funding after much of the damage has been done this hasn t stopped reckless left wing district attorneys such as chesa boudin in san francisco and alvin bragg in new york city from selectively deciding not to prosecute crimes biden mostly has dodged the idea that radical policies embraced by his democratic party are to blame for this issue 6 rising biden democrats skyrocketing us inflation in july biden said inflation would be a temporary problem that his administration had a handle on i want to be clear my administration understands that were we ever to experience unchecked inflation in the long term that would pose a real challenge for our economy biden said while we re confident that isn t what we re seeing today we re going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed what a lie that was now we re well into the new year and if anything inflation is getting worse for most americans inflation has become almost impossible to ignore even leading democrats have acknowledged that inflation is getting out of control in december inflation hit 7 the highest it has been since 1982 but this isn t the same situation as in the 1980s we are on the other side of the wave as the wall street journal has noted in 1982 inflation had fallen from its peak of 14 8 in 1980 the last year of jimmy carter s one term presidency correcting course required tight monetary policies from the federal reserve and a quick but sharp recession to pull the country out of the spiral upon becoming federal reserve chairman in 1979 paul volcker set out to crush inflation with tight monetary policy said greg ip in the wall street journal in combination with credit controls that effort pushed the u s into a brief recession in 1980 then as the fed s benchmark interest rate reached 19 in 1981 a much deeper recession began by the summer of 1982 inflation and interest rates were both falling sharply four decades of generally low single digit inflation would follow today inflation is rising not falling and it s been exacerbated by the policies of the biden administration rather than being lessened as it was in 1981 by the policies of the reagan administration rachel greszler an economics expert at the heritage foundation explains that biden and his legislative allies are making a bad situation worse 7 biden administration war on parents violent crime is spinning out of control but the justice department clearly doesn t see that as the real threat to this country no the real threat is parents who disagree with what s happening in their local schools parents around the country even in far left liberal san francisco have been organizing in response to the misguided and often egregious policies of many k 12 schools from the inclusion of critical race theory and similar racialized ideas in classroom curriculum to over the top covid 19 restrictions that forced students to stay home for over a year or wear masks all day long parents are fed up the result has been old fashioned self government in action however the response from the left has been to call transparency a threat to democracy demonize parents and threaten them with an fbi investigation in october attorney general merrick garland sent out a calling on the fbi to investigate violent threats against school officials and teachers despite a lack of evidence of such threats the biden administration actually moved to treat parents as if they were domestic terrorists it appears that garland s memo was urged on by the national school boards association which represents many local school boards the association also receives a huge amount of money from teachers unions in addition garland s son in law is a co founder of an organization that advocates culturally responsive training and other ideas associated with critical race theory so the attorney general s memo wasn t only an uncalled for threat to parents it also appeared to involve some serious conflicts of interest thank god garland is not on the supreme court pray for our country remember god s in charge and will have final word

Text: the night a subtly eerie incident befell night mare a lago it was a lovely starlit night beyond the artificially lightened land when a blood curdling scream brutally shattered the quiet it came from the humbly luxurious abode of the ex president trump continued to screech although he now was fully awake thrashing heavily about in his sweat soaked bed desperately trying to get free of the wet clinging sheets never had he had a dream like this it was pure horror he heaved for air and started sobbing and howling pitifully the nightmare had been so terribly vivid and it felt so real still so terribly unfamiliarly real in his dream he had woken up turned on the tv as usual and there was nothing there about him not even fox news talked about him not even cnn there was not a word and not a picture of him anywhere on social media nor in any newspaper no mention of him anywhere on the radio next thing he knew he was holding a news conference but something was dreadfully wrong the tv cameras were not rolling the journalists were not taking notes nor raising their arms to ask questions frantic with a crumbling sensation he regaled them with the most magnificent lie he could think of only to be met with turning backs and graveyard silence it was as if all hot air leaked out of him he felt like he was imploding in the dream he woke up again and realized he no longer was the president and an odd mix of despair and relief filled him then he remembered that he was the successful famous and popular owner of truth social and a gleeful yelp escaped him as he grabbed his phone to revel in all the massive praise and glory of his very own tremendously glamorous person the pages were never ending side up and side down they were all a complete blank all of a sudden he found himself standing in the middle of 5th avenue there were people everywhere people smiling and talking buying ice cream and popcorn from street vendors hoisting laughing children onto their shoulders as if awaiting some kind of celebration no one ever looked his way the dismay he felt was suffocating petrifying he felt as though he was losing all sense of himself the voices of the multitude surrounding him faded until there was an absolute silence suddenly a sound like a shot rang out and he recoiled in fear looking at his hands expecting them to be blackened by sooty powder in his inner ear he heard screams in his inner eye he saw fingers pointing at him and big hands coming for him strong firm big hands that didn't bother with protecting his head as they rammed him into a waiting squad car realizing he had uttered a pitiful squeal and instinctively thrown up his arms he quickly tried to compose his face in regal haughty folds as he stared wildly out at the crowd accomplishing nothing but a stiff crusty grimace but the people around him took no notice they did not seem to have heard the terrible sound and continued oblivious of him they were a colorful crowd a joyous crowd a hugely immense crowd a paralyzing desolation invaded him just then sounds began to creep back all around him and he became aware that the masses of people of whom many were now dancing in the streets were cheering and chanting his name but also another word an ugly word a word that had no business being together with his name the desperate righteousness that hearing this word produced in him made even the weak hairs on his scalp stand on end it was chillingly clear to him that this was not his kind of crowd these were not the manipulable people he despised so dearly where were they the people whose stupidity he loved and who in return loved the untruths and derision he so generously bedazzled them with panic set his bowels churning when it struck him that maybe he had been grifting them too greedily leaving them without even the bus fare to come to his defense when he needed to muster them they his adoring troops that there was an absolute absence of red hats amidst the surrounding celebratory crowd kindled within him a dreadful gut throttling sensation of being starved of all nourishment in the window of a storefront he glimpsed images of the crowd and thinking that he would feel better if only he could see his own majestic bulk mirrored back at him he moved towards the store his going syrupy and slow as if his feet generated a viscous swamp around them with every step he had hardly positioned himself before the glass when the mirror effect vanished in its stead he was now looking straight into deep grey fields fields filled with gravestones a tired dirty golden banner was stretched out above them decorated with the sprawling words president trump fixes the covid hoax he could not avoid noting that a great big number of the gravestones were topped with beautiful red hats but his precious letters didn't look quite right to him and upon squinting the letters abruptly shouted out into his face make americans dead before he had time to reflect on this however the gravestone fields took on a shimmering quality as if seen through a film of reluctantly flowing tears despite this a sharply defined white domed building had appeared looming in the background and fronted by a monstrous gallows and noose and even as from a great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting one certain insipid looking white haired human to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to be sluggishly moving towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed yes this wee short story may be a tad long for a youtube comment but people are enjoying it and encouraging me to continue sharing i was inspired to write the original story one fine halloween back when trump was president recent turn of events compelled me to dust it off make a few changes and adjustments and add some references to a little of what has been happening what has been said and what has been done trump wise after that essentially just actualize it a bit as it were

taxes and other legal responsibilities and rights here the us lags prostitutes are required by law to undergo regular medical examinations think of how many taxes would pour into american budgets at various levels without increasing the tax burden on current american taxpayers moreover american laws must be created against discrimination against prostitutes workers and business owners in the field of prostitution now in the united states there are numerous facts of discrimination epidemics and even murders there with the full connivance of the american media police fbi nsa cia feminists senates and congresses the presidential administration and human rights movements the lobby of american hospitals and big pharma are just slackers should the irs have a lobby in the senate and congress by the way prostitute workers are the same people as other americans moreover some people are forced to work in prostitution due to poverty and other difficult life situations therefore legalized american brothels should be given the right to apply for legalization of illegal migrants to the united states who work in prostitution but is creating several new laws a very hard job for american legislators do followers of the unfinished traditions of british puritanism prudishness and hypocrisy in the usa want the continuation of human rights violations in the usa american democrats don't think about it moreover the usa can simply solve many international problems because the american nation is the supreme master commander judge ruler and leader of all mankind the problem of taiwan must be solved in putin's way it's time to hold a referendum on taiwan's annexation to japan as an autonomous province if the taiwanese want this based on the results of the referendum taiwan will be protected by the military power of not only the united states but also japan the new president of argentina must make the falkland islands argentine again military or diplomatic option so that his pro american regime becomes more popular in addition to this in argentina the experiment requires lowering the independent age of marriage to 8 years so that at least human rights make serious progress there but the democratic party and their media the biden administration numerous american hawks and human rights activists do not think about all this americans vote republican the great donald trump can solve other problems that the democrats and their servants in the republican party are hesitant to solve that is servants of the deep state and globalists for example anti russian us sanctions should be applied to pro putin people who had or have russian citizenship who have acquired citizenship of the us eu israel and others why do this pro kremlin maxim galkin and alla pugacheva fled israel and abroad in today's difficult times for israelis lowering the morale of the israeli army and society despite the condemnation of russian society and formal kremlin sanctions against both alla pugacheva is already preparing new concerts in russia maxim galkin also prepared despite his video swearing oath to israel on his personal blog this proves the closeness of both creative people to the kremlin and russian oligarchs complete confiscation real estate money and more therefore us nato eu and israeli sanctions against maxim galkin and alla pugacheva are necessary revocation of us eu and israeli citizenship and deportation or forced service of both in the infantry of the israeli army for at least ten years some pro putin oligarchs live quietly abroad with foreign citizenship wealth and real estate without the threat of american anti russian sanctions for example oligarch media tycoon gusinsky plucking these oligarchs could enrich the us economy we hope new speaker mike johnson will address all of these issues but he still hasn t even dared to say that the usa is the master of the world he didn t even mention the global greatness of the american nation the great donald trump can solve these problems but vote for him in 2024 he will win with your support financial support is also important sell shares of the russian company aeroflot the price of which will fall even more aeroflot stock prices are simply falling into the abyss a symptom of the imminent collapse of the putin regime but you should buy us dollars that are rising in value the usa is the world ruler with a constantly growing economy so there are no prerequisites for the fall of this great dollar i write the truth and nothing but the truth looking for other sure fire ways to grow your wealth invest your money in donald trump's projects and elizaveta zaikina's concerts links are on my channel page if you want to increase your money elizaveta zaikina is a star a famous russian singer of international importance you can invite elizaveta zaikina to sing in your city this singer can be a good actress for hollywood films her influential friends may be useful to you too moreover you can order criticism for the film from dmitry ivanov link on this channel speaker mike johnson did not say that he would prioritize the interests of great america over the interests of foreign countries so we all have the right to criticize him is speaker mike johnson aligned with or opposed to donald trump for example on the greatness of the american nation and other maga in addition to this americans often do not distinguish between anti semitism and anti zionism anti semitism is a worldview against jews and arabs semites are arabs and jews anti zionism is a worldview against israel do you understand the difference although many americans mistakenly think that anti semitism and anti zionism are the same worldview against jews mount zion is located in israel that's why some americans call israel or the zionist community the israeli lobby in all states zion americans who have never lived with many years of employment outside the united states are doomed to be ignorant about the rest of the world and to be the laughing stock of the world if they express their opinions about foreign states and nations internationally including american businessmen who have never done business abroad ignorance and fear of travel do not grace the great american nation the ancestors of the american nation were very brave travelers who were not afraid to move to another continent therefore us citizens who are afraid of traveling abroad should be ashamed of their ancestors from other continents there are many great ignorances in the american democratic party including among the ruling democrats although among the ancestors of some of them there are greeks italians vikings arabs turks and other very brave nations donald trump's brave family defied the dem deep state this is an act worthy of the three hundred spartans of leonidas that's why i admire these american national heroes what is your opinion on

again so i dusted off the old story and adjusted it a bit made a few changes and added some references to later and more recent happenings actualized it in other words even for the tiny short story that it is it is long for a youtube comment but people are enjoying it and encouraging me to keep on sharing the night a subtly eerie incident befell night mare a lago it was a lovely starlit night beyond the artificially lightened land when a blood curdling scream brutally shattered the quiet it came from the humbly luxurious abode of the ex president trump continued to screech although he now was fully awake thrashing heavily about in his sweat soaked bed desperately trying to get free of the wet clinging sheets never had he had a dream like this it was pure horror he heaved for air and started sobbing and howling pitifully the nightmare had been so terribly vivid and it felt so real still so terribly unfamiliarly real in his dream he had woken up turned on the tv as usual and there was nothing there about him not even fox news talked about him not even cnn there was not a word and not a picture of him anywhere on social media nor in any newspaper no mention of him anywhere on the radio next thing he knew he was holding a news conference but something was dreadfully wrong the tv cameras were not rolling the journalists were not taking notes nor raising their arms to ask questions frantic with a crumbling sensation he regaled them with the most magnificent lie he could think of only to be met with turning backs and graveyard silence it was as if all hot air leaked out of him he felt like he was imploding in the dream he woke up again and realized he no longer was the president and an odd mix of despair and relief filled him then he remembered that he was the successful famous and popular owner of truth social and a gleeful yelp escaped him as he grabbed his phone to revel in all the massive praise and glory of his very own tremendously glamorous person the pages were never ending side up and side down they were all a complete blank all of a sudden he found himself standing in the middle of 5th avenue there were people everywhere people smiling and talking buying ice cream and popcorn from street vendors hoisting laughing children onto their shoulders as if awaiting some kind of celebration no one ever looked his way the dismay he felt was suffocating petrifying he felt as though he was losing all sense of himself the voices of the multitude surrounding him faded until there was an absolute silence suddenly a sound like a shot rang out and he recoiled in fear looking at his hands expecting them to be blackened by sooty powder in his inner ear he heard screams in his inner eye he saw fingers pointing at him and big hands coming for him strong firm big hands that didn't bother with protecting his head as they rammed him into a waiting squad car realizing he had uttered a pitiful squeal and instinctively thrown up his arms he quickly tried to compose his face in regal haughty folds as he stared wildly out at the crowd accomplishing nothing but a stiff crusty grimace but the people around him took no notice they did not seem to have heard the terrible sound and continued oblivious of him they were a colorful crowd a joyous crowd a hugely immense crowd a paralyzing desolation invaded him just then sounds began to creep back all around him and he became aware that the masses of people of whom many were now dancing in the streets were cheering and chanting his name but also another word an ugly word a word that had no business being together with his name the desperate righteousness that hearing this word produced in him made even the weak hairs on his scalp stand on end it was chillingly clear to him that this was not his kind of crowd these were not the manipulable people he despised so dearly where were they the people whose stupidity he loved and who in return loved the untruths and derision he so generously bedazzled them with panic set his bowels churning when it struck him that maybe he had been grifting them too greedily leaving them without even the bus fare to come to his defense when he needed to muster them they his adoring troops that there was an absolute absence of red hats amidst the surrounding celebratory crowd kindled within him a dreadful gut throttling sensation of being starved of all nourishment in the window of a storefront he glimpsed images of the crowd and thinking that he would feel better if only he could see his own majestic bulk mirrored back at him he moved towards the store his going syrupy and slow as if his feet generated a viscous swamp around them with every step he had hardly positioned himself before the glass when the mirror effect vanished in its stead he was now looking straight into deep grey fields fields filled with gravestones a tired dirty golden banner was stretched out above them decorated with the sprawling words president trump fixes the covid hoax he could not avoid noting that a great big number of the gravestones were topped with beautiful red hats but his precious letters didn't look quite right to him and upon squinting the letters abruptly shouted out into his face make americans dead before he had time to reflect on this however the gravestone fields took on a shimmering quality as if seen through a film of reluctantly flowing tears despite this a sharply defined white domed building had appeared looming in the background and fronted by a monstrous gallows and noose and even as from a great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting one certain insipid looking white haired human to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to be sluggishly moving towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed

great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting one certain insipid looking white haired human to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to be sluggishly moving towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed

Text: this is about as blatant an example of bad journalism as i've ever encountered just about every factoid cited is either completely inaccurate or else so slanted as to almost be laughable but worst of all is this guy's effort to politicize everything by automatically associating any questions concerning covid or covid vaccines with trump and the radical right the vast majority of doctors and scientists voicing reservations about covid and its various treatment protocols are not political at all rather they are doctors and scientists who actually understand that real science virtually mandates both an open mind and a willingness to question any and all ideas and opinions this video has nothing whatever to do with science and everything to do with true belief and the big pharma party line shame on him and shame on the organization he works for

Text: what trump need is a firm good strong embrace of accountability a nice tight long lasting embrace btw in case anyone should be interested in a longer read i was inspired to write the original shorter version of this story one halloween back when trump was president it was when he began talking about being arrested that i somehow got inspired again so i dusted off the old story and adjusted it a bit made a few changes and added some references to later and more recent happenings actualized it in other words even for the tiny short story that it is it is long for a youtube comment but people are enjoying it and encouraging me to keep on sharing the night a subtly eerie incident befell night mare a lago it was a lovely starlit night beyond the artificially lightened land when a blood curdling scream brutally shattered the quiet it came from the humbly luxurious abode of the ex president trump continued to screech although he now was fully awake thrashing heavily about in his sweat soaked bed desperately trying to get free of the wet clinging sheets never had he had a dream like this it was pure horror he heaved for air and started sobbing and howling pitifully the nightmare had been so terribly vivid and it felt so real still so terribly unfamiliarly real in his dream he had woken up turned on the tv as usual and there was nothing there about him not even fox news talked about him not even cnn there was not a word and not a picture of him anywhere on social media nor in any newspaper no mention of him anywhere on the radio next thing he knew he was holding a news conference but something was dreadfully wrong the tv cameras were not rolling the journalists were not taking notes nor raising their arms to ask questions frantic with a crumbling sensation he regaled them with the most magnificent lie he could think of only to be met with turning backs and graveyard silence it was as if all hot air leaked out of him he felt like he was imploding in the dream he woke up again and realized he no longer was the president and an odd mix of despair and relief filled him then he remembered that he was the successful famous and popular owner of truth social and a gleeful yelp escaped him as he grabbed his phone to revel in all the massive praise and glory of his very own tremendously glamorous person the pages were never ending side up and side down they were all a complete blank all of a sudden he found himself standing in the middle of 5th avenue there were people everywhere people smiling and talking buying ice cream and popcorn from street vendors hoisting laughing children onto their shoulders as if awaiting some kind of celebration no one ever looked his way the dismay he felt was suffocating petrifying he felt as though he was losing all sense of himself the voices of the multitude surrounding him faded until there was an absolute silence suddenly a sound like a shot rang out and he recoiled in fear looking at his hands expecting them to be blackened by sooty powder in his inner ear he heard screams in his inner eye he saw fingers pointing at him and big hands coming for him strong firm big hands that didn't bother with protecting his head as they rammed him into a waiting squad car realizing he had uttered a pitiful squeal and instinctively thrown up his arms he quickly tried to compose his face in regal haughty folds as he stared wildly out at the crowd accomplishing nothing but a stiff crusty grimace but the people around him took no notice they did not seem to have heard the terrible sound and continued oblivious of him they were a colorful crowd a joyous crowd a hugely immense crowd a paralyzing desolation invaded him just then sounds began to creep back all around him and he became aware that the masses of people of whom many were now dancing in the streets were cheering and chanting his name but also another word an ugly word a word that had no business being together with his name the desperate righteousness that hearing this word produced in him made even the weak hairs on his scalp stand on end it was chillingly clear to him that this was not his kind of crowd these were not the manipulable people he despised so dearly where were they the people whose stupidity he loved and who in return loved the untruths and derision he so generously bedazzled them with panic set his bowels churning when it struck him that maybe he had been grifting them too greedily leaving them without even the bus fare to come to his defense when he needed to muster them they his adoring troops that there was an absolute absence of red hats amidst the surrounding celebratory crowd kindled within him a dreadful gut throttling sensation of being starved of all nourishment in the window of a storefront he glimpsed images of the crowd and thinking that he would feel better if only he could see his own majestic bulk mirrored back at him he moved towards the store his going syrupy and slow as if his feet generated a viscous swamp around them with every step he had hardly positioned himself before the glass when the mirror effect vanished in its stead he was now looking straight into deep grey fields fields filled with gravestones a tired dirty golden banner was stretched out above them decorated with the sprawling words president trump fixes the covid hoax he could not avoid noting that a great big number of the gravestones were topped with beautiful red hats but his precious letters didn't look quite right to him and upon squinting the letters abruptly shouted out into his face make americans dead before he had time to reflect on this however the gravestone fields took on a shimmering quality as if seen through a film of reluctantly flowing tears despite this a sharply defined white domed building had appeared looming in the background and fronted by a monstrous gallows and noose and even as from a great distance he distinctly saw the fly hovering over the noose impatiently awaiting one certain insipid looking white haired human to photobomb again the gravestones were dancing gingerly before his sight and stretched up till they took on spectral forms among them the specters wearing his red hats seemed now to be sluggishly moving towards him the hats farther away resembling gleaming scarlet drops suddenly the mirror effect returned albeit the specters still shimmered in the gloomy depths of the window and what he saw before him was a slumped grey figure which dainty hands were red and dripping with gleaming scarlet drops the sudden sharp shot like sound he now realized had come from within him a crack and it was followed by several smaller cracks as if something hard but brittle dry and porous was breaking up and an awful smell filled his nostrils of something stale and greasy it made him gag as he did so his eyes fell on his arms and that was when the scream that woke him up exploded from his throat his arms were disintegrating they were turning into orange particles that floated glowing in the air before him shaking his head as though trying to rid it of the horrid impressions from the nightmare trump slowly became aware of noises around him doors banging people shouting running steps approaching still sobbing but feeling slightly comforted by the sound of people he turned on the light just as fists started banging on his door and voices shouted for him to open asking if he was ok he managed to twist himself free from the stubbornly clutching bedclothes almost falling out on the floor in so doing there was a sharp crack from his back as trump stumbled soggily towards the door sniffling softly and whimpering light fell onto tiny puddles of sweat among the folds of his sheets orange dust floated shimmering on the surface and just as trump reached out a dwindling tiny hand towards the door the repulsive stench from the nightmare brusquely lividly assaulted and filled his nostrils again something stale greasy cheesy more desperate now to get fresh air more than anything trump is about to turn around and try make a dash for the windows but this is when he is surprised by an ever so slight breeze hitting his feverish forehead and gently lifting a few delicate hairs almost losing his balance flailing his arms what he discerns before him through still moist eyes and the swirling orange particles raising from his arms is not anymore a solid door but glinting solid bars epilogue the grey orange hued figure still stood trumpetrified on the same spot he was overwhelmed by a feeling akin to the odd mix of despair and relief he had felt in his dream the feeling now being more like a strange blend of absolute dejection and timid almost hopeful relief it flooded him rendering him completely powerless from a place deep inside a profound place he till now had never known existed

Text: when is the left going to stop underestimating trump yes he is a crook liar and overall sleazy but the man went from 2 in the polls to the republican nomination and eventual election doing nothing else except self congratulating rallies when asked about policies he called them a secret he bullied his opponents and used nothing but talking points in debates he cut taxes for the very rich and convinced his base they were cuts for them he separated families at the border and locked up the children to provide a deterrent to border crossings he squashed a legal protest injuring peaceful protestors for a photo op with a bible he told the world he believed putin over his own intelligence services he had masked federal agents snatching people off the streets of liberal cities because they dared to march against him he convinced thousands of people to attack and occupy our greatest symbol of democracy resulting in the death of police officers he canceled nafta which would have bankrupted thousands of farmers that supported him only to resign pretty much an identical agreement days later he slapped massive tarriffs on chinese exports not realizing american companies pay the tariffs not the chinese resulting in even more jobs leaving the country he told ukraine a country that was in putin's crosshairs who was training and equipping their army for the eventual war that if they wanted weapons they had to announce an investigation into his main political rival he shut the government down just to get funding for a border wall every single expert said would not work he allowed his children to use their government positions to gain favors and patents from foreign countries he insulted wounded veterans and degraded soldiers that gave their life for their country he attempted multiple times to overturn an election he used prejudices misconceptions and lies in an attempt to win complete control of congress in 2018 he threatened and provoked an unstable dangerous nuclear armed regime in north korea before doing a 180 and started professing admiration for that country's authoritarian leader he insulted numerous foreign heads of state including shoving one out of the way to get a better position in a photo op he encouraged foreign dignitaries to stay at his hotels hinting that it would carry favor with him he attempted to ban anyone from a certain religion from entering the country then tried it again after the supreme court shot it down he ordered the immediate withdrawal from afghanistan 2 days after he lost the 2020 election in an attempt to cause embarrassment and problems for biden that by the time biden took office he could not reverse what had already been done he has called the free press the enemy of the people numerous times when he did not like the coverage he was getting for the first time in history he packed the courts with appointments based on their political beliefs not their understanding of the law he printed trillions of dollars then dumped it on the economy whenever the stock market dropped a few points in an attempt to create the illusion of a booming economy he ignored his own medical experts and encouraged his base's paranoia by condoning the wearing of masks and played down the danger of covid 19 leading to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of people he appointed friends and political cronies to important government positions encouraging them to dismantle and permanently handicap several agencies he did not agree with geez i could go on and on and on the man is obviously not as inept as you think he is he is baiting the judge so he can hopefully receive an overly harsh penalty providing a very good foundation for an appeal to a more friendly higher court the guy is a master manipulator and plays the press like a fiddle if he is doing something that looks foolish you had better believe he has an agenda behind it one of these judges needs to grow a pair and squash him before he has gotten the door open wide enough that it can never be closed again if you ever doubt his abilities just look at the list above after doing all of that and more leading to the deaths of probably close to a million people and destroying the lives of another million he not only maintained his base of supporters he added 10 million more to it remember he received the most votes any incumbant president in history if it wasn't for biden squeaking out a victory he would have received the most votes in history once someone declares their allegiance to trump and maga their loyalty seems to be unbreakable we can not let america forget the trump years because if he wins in 2024 he won't leave the white house until his death then like other former democracies that became an authoritarian dictatorship one of his sons will take over since he seems to like north korea so much my guess would be that eric will take the trump legacy the next 50 or so years smh i really am sad to see the support he gets today after everything he has done it has been truly shocking and a sobering experience to see him neck and neck with biden and 50 points ahead of his gop competitors after jan 6th alone to see him anywhere but behind bars after the totalling of everything he has done is depressing
