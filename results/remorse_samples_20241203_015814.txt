Text: there is a line between understanding and appeasement people in the media need to be courageous enough to defend that some thoughts are just plain abhorrent and should be confronted in the 1930s the american nazis and kkk were spreading propaganda against jewish people and other minorities should people have elevated their concerns to the same level as those of the jewish people who were being targeted do they not realize that there were nazis who were decent husbands wives fathers mothers etc citizens need to stop behaving like teenagers with freedom comes with responsibility in a society those responsibilities also extend to those around us there has to be a mutual respect you cannot expect me to appreciate your views when you are actively trying to disenfranchise me van jones cnn and their 'false equivalency' bothsiderism crap needs to be stopped if van jones and cnn are serious about engaging these people then they listen to the ones who left those movements instead of inserting their na ve ignorant points of view bigotry should never be excused the fact that someone calls himself a christian does not mean that he follows the words of jesus in case they forgot the bible was used by confederates to justify slavery anyone whose ideology mandates the disenfranchisement of another group because of their 'race' religion sex gender etc needs to be confronted while that man's views should be considered the fact remains that they were from a place of ignorance this is especially why history needs to be promoted and taught in schools his argument on the vaccine is not new people like that man will also not hesitate to enforce their rules on others while claiming martyrdom and prosecution as we can see in texas alabama florida and other states the founding fathers may have made many errors but one thing they were clear about was the separation of religion from government the united states is not and has never been a christian nation christianity also does not promote nation building so enough of this nonsense nazis were not entertained in the 40s and neither should these remnants of the confederacy

Text: what's the next push for the vaccine will people get raptured and the government tell the left behind that it was aliens and only the vaccinated was protected and then they finish the trick to get people to go up and fight against god telling people there are aliens along with some proof some of it halographic would do the trick dont fall for it this someone person is the false prophet that will cause you to put your trust in the anti christ so just keep looking for that person while refusing jabs you will know they are the false prophet because that is what the bible says the false prophet does and please help me spread dumbed down message even a less complicated thinker will understand this side note 1st corinthians 6 19 19 do you not know that your bodies are temples of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own 1st corinthians 3 16 you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit dwells in your midst you missed the first sign the mark of the beast don't fall for the other signs please you can live in paradise before the fall satan made sure there was pride this is why i said they are having doctors and nurses dance on tv and the social websites and getting promoted to do so in early 2020 pride pride satan does not just need them to be on his side he wants pride to keep them from repenting this is the way of not repenting and be liable to hell they can't admit they was wrong and turn around why pride with all this evidence pride sadly it is working on some interesting i misspelled medicine it came out medicide so naturally i looked it up wow it's a word alright now the question is is medicide closer to suicide or genocide they wanted all doctors nurses and blacks to take it first or omnicide one of the big reasons people will stop going to churches and didn't protest i'm going to tell you a conspiracy since i am batting a 100 the vaccine downgrades the vmat2 gene which gives you the religious zeal right or wrong independent thinking the ability to stick to emotional indignation right or wrong this is way stronger than fluoride this is also a big reason why there will be a great falling away i cannot post links here you have to go to youtubes competitors for proof because they instantly block these links what will be the next big push to get people to take the vaccine called the mark of the beast here is a scenario that people would fall for the rapture happen and then they show some of the ships some holographs to make more and the government will tell you that the reason that you did not get abducted no they will admit ruptured they government will tell you it was the vaccine preventing you from getting abducted which will be really raptured then they will get all the trusting ones to take the vaccine and the conspiracy theorist raptured will not be done here to get people to see the truth not most anyway some of those being left behind will be in a second rapture this will be a bigger test because satan wants to use discouragement notice the multiple accounts in the scriptures and christ telling us let not those in the field first expect more than those the joined later but you still need to be talking to god about it in jesus name because as the father in charge of punishment he is the one determining repentance every knows that in revelations chapter 6 the white red black pale horses will ride causing people to take a scorpions tail needle white horse wars and rumors of war red horse prices of food and energy and medicine and entertainment to rise

not repentant about trusting man and not god the science was a code word or code phrase for trust man this symbol means new point being made you will never guess where i am leading with this don't you find it strange that biddens presidency is mirroring trump's presidency's problems even way worse example the news made fun of trump for his text's spelling and grammar comments about he would date his daughter if he was her age and free now we have bidden with way worse words and text the news made fun of trump junior for mental problems and mistakes now bidden has his crackhead son the news made fun of trump screwing up international relations now we have bidden leaving people and military equipment in iraq and dragging us into ukraine and possibly a world war this is so blantant a set up trump will swoop in and 'save' the world from all these problems unless god stops it why because he is the false prophet trying to look like john the baptist and he will lead us to the anti christ unless god cuts this short also on another subject when the rapture happens and then the government new will show some of the ships some holographs to make more and the government will tell you that the reason that you did not get abducted no they will admit ruptured they government will tell you it was the vaccine preventing you from getting abducted which will be really raptured then they will get all the trusting ones to take the vaccine and the conspiracy theorist raptured will not be done here to get people to see the truth not most anyway some of those being left behind will be in a second rapture this will be a bigger test because satan wants to use discouragement notice the multiple accounts in the scriptures and christ telling us let not those in the field first expect more than those the joined later but you still need to be talking to god about it in jesus name because the father is in charge of punishment he is the one determining repentance

Text: you can begin with the issues that our own government is creating printing money to finance war after war bombing and killing others in the name of control if america is the 'big daddy' of all countries then it is uniquely positioned to assume the role of a true leader one that champions peaceful relations instead of instigating conflict and destruction true leadership is about fostering understanding cooperation and peace not perpetuating cycles of violence and suffering it's time for a shift in priorities where diplomacy and empathy guide our actions rather than aggression and dominance you can also begin with the issue that a president should not mandate a vaccine that has not been fully tested thereby handicapping its own people mandating an unproven vaccine not only infringes on individual rights but also raises serious questions about the government's duty to protect its citizens true leadership should prioritize thorough research transparency and respect for individual autonomy it's imperative that leaders uphold these principles to build trust and ensure the well being of the population instead of knocking someone else who is only trying to understand the situation from both sides why don't you begin with the issues i just mentioned it would make you a better reporter than reporting on what another reporter is doing maybe then you may rise to the level of reporting that tucker obviously has reached i hope this answers your question on where to begin

Text: reasons i support kennedy first off the majority of people who believe the narrative that rfkjr is a crazy conspiracy theorist' do so because their knowledge of him is not knowledge but rather a caricature image artfully crafted by the corporate media using carefully cut sound bytes and misdirections why they are owned and paid for by big pharma big ag big oil and big chemical you don't bite the hand that feeds you kennedy is a man with plans carefully thought out plans one has to just check his website or his podcast for all his policies or listen to any of dozens of podcasts he's appeared on he's a man of integrity who genuinely wants to heal the division in our nation he's in a unique place as an independent to engage both sides of the isle like never before he's loved by people of all walks of life from all over the world who are tired of the american duopoly that george washington warned would destroy america 200 years ago washington interestingly was first and only independent president we have ever had kennedy s humble not afraid to be proven wrong and correct himself on important issues when presented with new facts or alternative viewpoints in other words he does not blindly dig in his heels and argue for something he doesn't believe in in order to toe the party line or appease corporate powers he's not afraid to change his mind as he did on the border and abortion rights issues he's never been a sockpuppet for the gop or dnc in the past nor any corporation for that matter and has proven he can't be bullied in his 40 years of campaigns and litigations against corporate greed and corruption the man appears on several long format podcasts weekly he prefers long format discussions healthy debates and challenges rather than quick sound bytes or attacks as he's a man of contemplation and introspection he actually listens and deeply considers problems and potential solutions you will never hear him attack biden or trump in a demeaning manner he has no interest as it doesn't solve anything but rather fuels the divide he's very vocal about corporate capture of our government and media and how he will dismantle it he's committed to ending the forever wars sucking our tax dollars by closing half of the international bases that only sow the seeds of resentment around the world ending the international arms dealing cutting the military budget in half in order to redirect that money to our own desperately neglected infrastructure here at home he wants to rein in nato and negotiate peace in the region rather than continue to provoke an endless and expensive war he's not interested in weaponizing law against his opponents as is happening now it's a waste of money and only serves to martyr opponents in his opinion i want to beat them on a debate stage he has often said not in a courtroom he has only ever been interested in challenging his opponents to open and honest debate over existential policies rather than shallow culture war issues that divide the nation he's determined to outlaw pharmaceutical advertisements in the media essentially freeing media from the corporate capture they are beholden to 70 of cable advertising is currently pharmaceutical ads making it impossible for anyone on mainstream media to criticize big pharma again you don't bite the hand that feeds you cnn he's determined to keep the pharmaceutical industry honest and transparent with publicized safety tests of every product including potential new vaccines and will never mandate a vaccine on a healthy person he will not blindly follow the corrupt experts who have held positions of authority for 50 years faucci and have lied about their practices to the public and under oath to not question the experts in kennedy's opinion is not only unconstitutional and not a value of democracy but one of a totalitarian government kennedy is never afraid to question and challenge the so called experts he has a solid plan for healing america's addictions to legal and illegal drugs ultra processed foods sugar and high fructose corn syrup he's a recovering addict who fell into a dark hole after his father was murdered he has been open and honest about it always and continues to seek solutions to america s addiction crisis see the youtube film healing america's addictions he truly understands blockchain technology and says he will put the federal budget on blockchain where it will be publicly available for anyone to audit that alone is a feat worthy of a vote for presidency imagine that he also understands the importance of free peer to peer decentralized digital currency bitcoin uncontrollable and incorruptible by banks and governments and has vowed to keep self custody of crypto currency legal and free and to block centralized central bank digital currencies our current administration has been pushing to outlaw self custody of cryptocurrency since 2022 claiming that they need to protect us from ourselves kennedy will pardon julian assange he was forced to plead guilty edward snowden and ross ulbrict during his first days in office as they fundamentally represent what it is to be an american in search of freedom truth and transparency he's determined to put a cap limit on real estate that can be owned by blackrock fidelity and the likes who are currently buying up properties at an alarming rate in order to artificially inflate the market this is market manipulation and he's assured us he will not allow it to proceed to keep young americans from buying homes as an experienced environmental attorney it goes without saying that he's going to continue to promote clean water clean soil clean air and regenerative farming he has enforced this with his vp pick he wants to bring preventative health maintenance into the forefront as the unhealthiest nation in the world with an atrocious sick care system kennedy wants to focus on nutrition and food as medicine not pharmaceutical wonder drugs that do little more than mask symptoms his border policy of higher walls and wider gates means that he will close the border to illegals and send asylum judges to the border to expedite procedures for legal immigrants he is not going to continue to write blank checks to netanyahu for him to use as he sees fit in his war on palestine kennedy actually hosts a podcast currently on which he invites both palestinians and israelis on for healthy and constructive dialogue has any other potential leader done that given his family history his own studies in world history and training as an attorney he is well suited for dialogue and mitigation in his podcast his guests have already brought many ideas for a peaceful solution to the table given kennedy's relentless successes against monsanto pheizer exxon dow and a host of other corrupt polluters and war mongers i don't believe kennedy will allow himself to be governed by corrupt health officials or the military industrial complex he's proven this time and again he's a writer yes he can write and his books are deeply profound and very enlightening full of facts and educated hypotheses people love to claim they are full of lies and misinformation most of those people have never read a single page if they had they would know that he puts qr code citations for everything and he's an attorney who knows what the consequences of lying are if he has lied then why has he never been sued for libel or slander and finally kennedy is an activist this is huge for me i relate to that an activist by definition is someone who takes action he has put his freedom and profession on the line for countless americans puerto ricans canadians native americans and mexicans he's been arrested dozens of times for his environmental activism this is the kind of man i want running our nation ya know

Text: after trump won more than 50 of the vote in iowa where haley placed a distant third members of the republican party quickly consolidated around the former president and endorsed him former 2024 candidates including biotech entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy south carolina sen tim scott and north dakota gov doug burgum campaigned with trump on the eve of the new hampshire primary florida gov ron desantis also took a parting shot at haley as he exited the field calling her platform a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism there was not a similar rush of support behind haley though former arkansas gov asa hutchinson endorsed her former new jersey gov chris christie did not and was caught on a hot mic saying she would get smoked haley entered the gop presidential race in february of last year becoming the first person after trump to launch a 2024 bid she polled in the low single digits for much of the first six months of her campaign but gained momentum after the first gop primary debate in august where she called for a consensus on abortion and stood out for her foreign policy experience she was well received in subsequent debates which helped fuel interest from voters and donors by late fall many wealthy republicans and some democrats looking for an alternative to trump started rallying behind haley she received the endorsement of billionaire charles koch s political network in november and her campaign announced it raised 24 million in the last quarter of the year she was also endorsed by sununu bolstering her campaign in one of her most promising states where 40 of registered voters identify as independent that momentum drew the attention of her rivals who started digging into her record and attempted to paint her as a candidate beholden to her donors desantis and his allies attempted to undercut her tough stance on china by highlighting her work wooing chinese companies to south carolina haley responded that governors across the country were recruiting chinese business at the time but that the us now has a better understanding of its relationship with china some of the wounds were self inflicted in mid november haley called for name verification of social media accounts which would have virtually eliminated anonymous posting she quickly retreated after a wave of backlash ahead of the iowa caucuses desantis latched on to a comment she made joking that iowa starts the nominating process and new hampshire corrects the results her biggest stumble came at the end of 2023 when she was asked about the cause of the civil war during an event in new hampshire haley failed to mention slavery in her response which prompted a wave of criticism from democrats and republicans in the days that followed she said that she was wrong to leave out slavery and highlighted her own experiences with racism as the daughter of indian immigrants who grew up in rural south carolina her views on race were highlighted again in january when she told a fox news host that the us has never been a racist country despite its history with legal discrimination haley argued that while she had experienced racism in her life she believed the country wasn t founded with the intent to perpetuate racism but haley known for saying she kick s back harder also went after her rivals she frequently blasted ramaswamy over his foreign policy stances accused desantis of lying about her record because he s losing and said trump was throwing temper tantrums because she was gaining on him after her third place finish in iowa haley declared the nominating contest a two person race between herself and trump a prediction that came true after desantis ended his campaign days before the granite state primary the race grew personal between trump and haley the former president elevated a post that falsely claimed haley wasn t eligible to be president because her parents weren t citizens when she was born in south carolina echoing the birther smears he had once leveled against former president barack obama trump also took to misspelling her first name nimarata nikki is the former governor s middle name and mocking her haley meanwhile questioned trump s mental competency after the former president confused her with former house speaker nancy pelosi during a campaign rally haley s political career started in 2004 when she beat a 30 year incumbent in a gop primary for a state house seat in lexington county south carolina during her 2010 gubernatorial bid she beat a congressman the state attorney general and the lieutenant governor in a crowded republican primary and narrowly beat her democratic opponent in the general election at the time haley was seen as a rising gop star and potential vice presidential pick in 2012 and 2016 she was selected to give the gop response in 2016 to president barack obama s final state of the union address on the presidential campaign trail haley highlighted her work in south carolina bringing jobs to the state and enacting conservative policies such as voter id and abortion restrictions one of the defining moments of haley s governorship came in 2015 when a white supremacist gunman killed nine black churchgoers at charleston s mother emanuel ame church after years of calling the confederate flag a sensitive issue haley called for the flag to be removed from the statehouse grounds days after the killings haley spent six years as governor of south carolina before becoming trump s ambassador to the united nations in 2017 as a presidential candidate she spoke often of the two years she spent at the un and the perspective it gave her on threats facing the us her calculated departure from the trump administration after two years on the job raised speculation about what was next for her she spent nearly a year on the board of boeing a company she worked with extensively in her south carolina days but resigned in march 2020 after executives discussed seeking covid 19 relief funding in the wake of the january 6 2021 attack on the us capitol haley said she believed her old boss had no future in politics and would not run for president in 2024

Text: joe listened to trump's answers too much reagan reused a zinger or two four years after taking down carter trump is saying the same things he said 8 years ago he's not a moving target joe could afford to ignore trump's schoolyard taunts and focus on pre planned answers t doesn't matter what he says b if he is secretly recorded showing battle plans to a chinese agent at his bedmister golf course how many times has he shown classified documents to a foreign agent when a reporter was not there to record it and people want this guy to have security clearance again the only reason he had it last time was that he was president he wouldn't have gotten it if appointed to any lower level post because of all his entanglements he gave five jobs to a family member who couldn't get security clearance and gave that family member's father a pardon t doesn't matter what he says b i don't know why you're asking him if he's going to concede if he loses this election 70 lost court cases later he still hasn't conceded for the last election he takes roy cohn's advice to deny deny deny a little too literally you remember roy cohn trump's late lawyer and also joe mccarthy's lead counsel during the red scare t doesn't matter what he says b trump went to saudi arabia to turn off the spigots i went there to open them back up again t doesn't matter what he says b not one gop member of the house voted for anti pricegouging legislation that's quite something considering that half of the price increases we've seen are because of price gouging due to the pandemic t doesn't matter what he says b one of the shortages we've had was in baby formula nafta was one of many treaties that trump renegotiated without understanding it first he taxed baby formula imports at 17 and actively discouraged importing formula from canada now he wants to push an inflationary tariff policy that has led fortune 500 ceos to donate not one dollar to his campaign because they know his plan will worsen inflation and add 5t to the national debt t doesn't matter what he says b if they were good times why did he add 7t to the national debt before the pandemic started you don't give away 1 5t to the top 1 for stock buybacks in good times you save it to soften the next downturn i inherited a recession and haven't had one since you inherited the fruits of good economic policy and took credit for it t doesn't matter what he says b yeah let's talk about the stock market during the pandemic you told everyone things were find the virus would subside by april you were just buying time for gop congressmen to dump their stock while prices were still high t doesn't matter what he says b you're brave to bring up fraud surely you invented it the fake elector scheme alone is disqualifying if your supporters were truly patriotic the fake elector scheme that you and giuliani cooked up would be enough for them to disavow you t doesn't matter what he says b you can't even say the word rebuttal or refute you can't even type out news coverage you think your youngest son the one who just graduated from college is 17 you think we have u s troops in ukraine you think it's a good idea to desert a prison of 2 500 isis fighters you freed 5 000 taliban although you denied it afterward once you saw how stupid it was you gave the order for all military families to leave south korea because you misunderstood what a general said on fox you need to stop getting your ideas from fox man it's making you stupid but then you always have been your education stalled at 8th grade because you twisted your sister 9 years your senior to do your homework for you and you're still a brat t doesn't matter what he says b doe 174 here balked when asked by fox if he'd open the epstein files fox edited his response as everyone knows fox lawyers argue in court that no reasonable person would believe that fox is trying to be accurate or factual fox knows the truth about this guy oh and if you read the new york post owned by rupert murdoch you might not know this since they never reported it but fox owned by rupert murdoch and mohammed bin salman settled with dominion for 770m for spreading trump's big lie you might remember mohammed bin salman the guy who trump met with to turn off the spigots to raise gas prices the guy who had a reporter critical of him kidnapped in the saudi embassy in turkey and cut up with a bone saw you'd like to treat reporters like that wouldn't you donald tell us how screwed up you think dominion's voting machines are donald i dare you t doesn't matter what he says b nixon dirty trickster roger stone got 40 months for committing crimes for trump trump got no time for stone's crimes trump maintains plausible deniability he commits crimes by remote control has someone else take the fall he's kind of like bin laden like that trump pardoned him charging trump or any of his thugs while he was still in office was a waste of taxpayer money trump would just pardon them all now stone is on hidden camera saying another violent insurrection won't be necessary that he and his dirty tricksters are far more prepared to overturn the will of the people if trump loses again he says he has a lawyer and judge on speed dial who's the lawyer who's the judge care to tell us trump i dare you t doesn't matter what he says b you wouldn't lead you wouldn't be a proper model and wear a mask because you didn't want your makeup smeared people refused the vaccine because you talked up horse de wormer and made everyone afraid of anything fauci advised do you think this guy was slumming it with horse de wormer he was hording monoclonal antibodies for himself and people sufficiently loyal to him or famous people he wanted to kiss up to and that's why the deaths after the vaccines came out were disproportionately in red states but you're not going to apologize to them for misleading them like that are you because malignant narcissists don't apologize they don't acknowledge they did anything wrong no matter how much the evidence piles up against their claims t doesn't matter what he says b you'd think that of all times to have a germophobe anxious to close the borders in the oval office a pandemic would be the time it would be helpful but it wasn't you fell short on both counts t i did not have sex with that woman b you paid stormy daniels 130 000 not to have sex with you there's no art in that deal

Text: better understanding of autism by you know listening to autistic people means higher detection the ratio of autistic children children was 7 in 2007 which is the first prevalence reporting made by the cdc i'd like to remind you that in 2007 it was believed to be a majorly male condition and also specific presentations were diagnostic criteria rather than underlying behavior obsession with trains or dinosaurs for instance while a 2008 article posited the reason for it's skewed rate in males was because girls tended to become obsessed with things like anime manga for instance using this to point out that it's this obsessive quality special interest or spin in community that should be looked for and not the subject of such spins today the number sits around 2 4 considering the underrepresented to nonrepresented females bipoc queer and other minority groups that doesn't seem like such a huge increase in the 90s and 00s a plurality of those diagnosed autistic were middle to upper class white cisheterosexual males which is a very very specific group and not actually the be all end all basis of usaian plus we no longer have a second arbitrary diagnosis of aspergers it's all autism now as it always was but with a rating scale based on needed aid and not functionality considering autism has been detected in utero i say very confidently that vaccines didn't cause it however if i wasn't conceived developed born and raised autistic if it had been some side effect from a vaccine that prevented polio or measles or rubella or mumps good because i can say with 100 certainty that an autistic child is better than a dead one autism has never killed anyone just ignorant ableist assholes who wish to put their child out of their misery whose misery eh the child's or yours auti m peaks actually had an ad that included a mother who if she didn't have another daughter counting on her would have committed murder suicide by driving her and her autistic daughter into the river tell me again how a shot is the problem the diseases can kill and people can kill but growing up disabled isn't the end of the world we're only considered disabled because society wasn't built by people with brains that work like ours how many of you wear glasses in 1941 you'd be 4 f when trying to enlist in the army unfit for duty poor eyesight colorblindness were disabilities that prevented battle readiness in 1942 for cultural reasons remediable defects were suddenly acceptable if you could wear collective lenses you could join the army cut to 2024 when glasses are considered a normality to the point wear a bunch of people wear fake glasses because they're stylish when i say society dictates what is disability this is how also it's way more likely for society to move towards accommodating autis than accommodating the deceased

repenting and being liable to hell they can't admit they were wrong and turn around why pride with all this evidence pride sadly it is working on some the government knew that once they introduce pride to the doctors and nurses they can't will stay trapped and not turn on them and it is working when they tell you trust the science they are saying trust man's science not gods new world order is

interesting i misspelled medicine it came out medicide so naturally i looked it up wow it's a word alright now the question is is medicide closer to suicide or genocide they wanted all doctors nurses

people to take the vaccine called the mark of the beast here is a scenario that people would fall for the rapture happen and then they show some of the ships some holographs to make more and the government will tell you that the reason that you did not get abducted no they will admit ruptured they government will tell you it was the vaccine preventing you from getting abducted which will be really raptured then they will get all the trusting ones to take the vaccine and the conspiracy theorist raptured will not be done here to get people to see the truth not most anyway some of those being left behind will be in a second rapture this will be a bigger test because satan wants to use discouragement notice the multiple accounts in the scriptures and christ telling us let not those in the field first expect more than those the joined later but you still need to be talking to god about it in jesus' name because as the father in charge of punishment he is the one determining repentance every 1 knows that in revelations chapter 6 the white red black pale horses will ride causing people to take a scorpions tail needle white horse wars and rumors of war red horse prices of food and energy and medicine and entertainment to rise black horse and death following pale horse and they knew that someone will come on the scene and save the world from these things because the bible says this person will come to save us what the next push for the vaccine will people get raptured and the government tell the left behind that it was aliens and only the vaccinated was protected and then they finish the trick to get people to go up and fight against god telling people there are aliens along with some proof some of it holographic would do the trick dont fall for it every one knows that in revelations chapter 6 the white red black pale horses will ride causing people to take a scorpions tail needle white horse wars and rumors of war red horse prices of food and energy and medicine and entertainment to rise black horse and death following pale horse and they knew that someone will come on the scene and save the world from these things because the bible says this person will come to save us no regrets this is saying to god you are not repentant about trusting man and not god the science was a code code phrase for trust man you will never guess where i am leading with this don't you find it strange that biddens is mirroring trump's presidency's problems even way worse example the news made fun of trump for his text's spelling and grammar comments about he would date his daughter if he was her age and free now we have bidden with way worse words and text the news made fun of trump junior for mental problems and mistakes now bidden has his crackhead son the news made fun of trump screwing up international relations now we have bidden leaving people and military equipment in iraq and dragging us into ukraine and possibly a world war this is so blantant a set up trump will swoop in and 'save' the world from all these problems unless god stops it why because he is the false prophet trying to look like john the baptist and he will lead us to the anti christ unless god cuts this short also on another subject when the rapture happens and then the government new will show some of the ships some holographs to make more and the gov will tell you that

the vaccine will people get raptured and the government tell the left behind that it was aliens because of the vaccine and then they finish the trick to get people to go up and fight against god telling people there are aliens abducing along with some proof some of it may be holographic do not fall for it

Text: the reason why i will never support the government of israel and neither should you during the 1970s and 1980s there were reports and allegations that israel provided military support and weapons to the apartheid regime in south africa the apartheid regime in south africa enforced a system of racial segregation and discrimination oppressing the majority black population in the country here are some key points regarding the allegations of israeli support to the south african apartheid regime 1 military cooperation there were reports of military cooperation between israel and south africa during the apartheid era israel allegedly provided military equipment technology and expertise to the south african government 2 allegations of arms sales there were allegations that israel sold weapons including military aircraft armored vehicles and ammunition to the apartheid regime in south africa these sales were reportedly used by the south african government to suppress internal dissent and opposition to apartheid policies 3 political motivations the alleged military cooperation between israel and south africa during this period was influenced by various factors including shared security interests geopolitical considerations and a common perception of threats in their respective regions 4 international criticism the reported military cooperation between israel and the apartheid regime in south africa drew international criticism and condemnation many countries and organizations viewed such support as contributing to the perpetuation of human rights abuses and oppression in south africa 5 end of apartheid with the end of apartheid in the early 1990s and the establishment of a democratic government in south africa these allegations of israeli support to the apartheid regime became a subject of historical scrutiny and criticism it is important to note that the details and extent of israeli support to the apartheid regime in south africa during that period remain a subject of historical debate and controversy the allegations have been a point of criticism for israel's foreign policy during that era and have been cited as an example of international support for oppressive regimes copy paste and share israel's health ministry is investigating claims that ethiopian women are being injected with a controversial contraceptive without their knowledge or consent thousands of ethiopian women are said to be receiving shots of depo provera every three months in israeli clinics the contraceptive stops menstruation and has been linked to fertility problems and osteoporosis yaakov litzman israel's deputy minister of health who has previously denied the practice will lead the inquiry a spokesperson announced on wednesday the phenomenon was uncovered when social workers noticed the birth rate among ethiopian immigrants halving in a decade an israeli documentary investigating the scandal was aired in december and prompted a popular outcry it revealed that women were started on a course of contraceptive jabs while still in transit camps in ethiopia some without being told they were being given birth control and many having no idea of the side effects when they eventually arrived in israel doctors continued the treatment unquestioningly but the critical question remains unanswered as to who instigated the policy with neither israel nor ethiopia willing to claim responsibility sava reuben an ethiopian who has lived in israel since 1984 interviewed more than 35 women from her community for the film and found that 25 were still receiving contraceptive shots from healthcare providers reuben spoke to one woman who believed she had been given a flu vaccination and had no idea she had been injected with depo provera another was pregnant with her fifth child when she arrived in the transit camp where she would live for seven years the woman in her thirties told reuben that officials had gathered together all the new mothers in the camp and told them they would be given depo provera as it would be too difficult for them to give birth israel no we didn't want to take it we refused we said we didn't want it the unnamed woman recalls in the film she agreed to the injections only because she was told her immigration to israel would be blocked and she would receive no further healthcare in the camps if she refused this happened to many many other women reuben said more than 50 000 ethiopian jews have immigrated to israel in the past decade the fast growing community has struggled against bias in 1996 thousands rioted when it was discovered that the israeli health ministry had destroyed all stocks of blood donated by ethiopians on the grounds that it might be contaminated with hiv israel's health ministry has strongly denied allegations that the injections are part of a policy to control the growth of the ethiopian community the israel ministry of health neither advises nor encourages the use of depo provera injections and if they are being administered this is in despite of our view a spokesperson said and yet reuben claims to have discovered a letter from the health ministry to a clinic in ethiopia in 2000 thanking doctors there for the large numbers of women they had treated with depo provera why are only ethiopian women being given depo provera in israel it's supposed to be a last resort contraceptive israeli health authorities claim the injections are a cultural preference but in our culture to have lots of children is to be rich reuben said it is my opinion that this is a deliberate policy on the part of israel they are taking advantage of women who are weak because they are new to the country do not understand the language and who traditionally respect authority it makes me more than angry dr mushira aboodia a gynaecologist working at jerusalem's hadassah medical centre said the majority of ethiopian women she had met received depo provera injections this is a policy that no one will admit no one in israel will take responsibility for the treatment in the camps but someone must have instigated it and it would not be in ethiopia's interests to treat women preparing to leave the country aboodia said something is definitely wrong here i'm very glad the ministry of health will be investigating the issue they will need to do a thorough job a message from betsy reed editor of the guardian us i hope you appreciated this article before you move on i wanted to ask if you would consider supporting the guardian s journalism during one of the most consequential news cycles of our lifetimes from elon musk to the murdochs a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what s happening in the world the guardian is different we have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider our journalism is produced to serve the public interest not profit motives and we avoid the trap that befalls much us media the tendency born of a desire to please all sides to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality we always strive to be fair but sometimes that means calling out the lies of powerful people and institutions and making clear how misinformation and demagoguery can damage democracy from threats to election integrity to the spiralling climate crisis to complex foreign conflicts our journalists contextualise investigate and illuminate the critical stories of our time as a global news organisation with a robust us reporting staff we re able to provide a fresh outsider perspective one so often missing in the american media bubble around the world readers can access the guardian s paywall free journalism because of our unique reader supported model that s because of people like you our readers keep us independent beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone whether they can afford to pay for news or not
