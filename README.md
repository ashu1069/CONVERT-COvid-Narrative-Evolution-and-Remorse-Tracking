Vaccination policies have been a focal point in the fight against diseases like COVID-19. However, public perceptions of these policies are often influenced by how the media frames vaccination, potentially leading to vaccine hesitancy. This project aims to analyze the relationship between the framing of vaccination policies in various media outlets and its impact on vaccine hesitancy.

This project is of significant importance to public policymakers in the field of vaccination. Its relevance extends beyond academic interest, directly connecting to my current work on developing a global vaccine model prioritization system. In this larger project, I'm constructing a priority list for immunization proposals, taking into account various static and dynamic factors related to epidemiology and the proposing nations. By investigating the impact of media framing on vaccine hesitancy, this study will provide crucial insights that can validate and refine the weight factors used in our data fusion pipeline. Understanding how media influences public perception and vaccine uptake will allow us to more accurately assess the potential effectiveness and reception of different vaccination strategies across diverse populations and regions.

## Objectives
- Explore how political and ideological biases in media framing shape public opinion on vaccination.
- Examine the correlation between media framing and vaccine uptake.
- Analyze regional differences in media framing and vaccine hesitancy rates.

## Key Concepts for Analysis
- General Framing Keyword Pairs
  - Safety vs. Risk
  - Public Health vs. Individual Choice
  - Scientific Consensus vs. Uncertainty
  - Social Responsibility vs. Personal Freedom
- Political Framing Keyword Pairs
  - Individual Liberty vs. Collective Responsibility
  - Limited Government vs. Public Health Mandate
  - Personal Choice vs. Societal Obligation
  - Free Market Solutions vs. Government Interventions
  - Traditional Values vs. Progressive Policies

## Methodology
- Media Analysis
  - Examine how media outlets align with specific political parties to frame vaccination policies.
  - Correlate framing approaches with vaccine hesitancy rates among their audience.
- Case Studies
  - Focus on specific events or policy announcements.
  - Analyze framing differences between politically aligned media outlets.
 
This study will contribute to understanding how media influences public health decisions, potentially informing future communication strategies for vaccination campaigns and other public health initiatives.
